1253,campaign donors exhausted,It’s Day 1 of the Trump Campaign—and His Donors Are Already Exhausted,"There’s a hard rule against candidates using leadership PACs to support their own political efforts, so Trump’s campaign can’t touch any of that money. And that fact has led him to adopt some creative, confusing, and possibly unlawful ways of moving it around.First, Trump created a new campaign committee for his 2024 re-election bid—“Donald J. Trump for President 2024.” That will give the one-term hopeful a more or less clean start on fundraising, albeit with some key structural benefits over his rivals.One of those advantages is the extensive donor contact list Trump has built up over the years. Trump has used that information to raise money since leaving the White House, but he has to find a way for the new campaign to get its hands on that valuable data—and he doesn’t want to have to pay for it.The Trump team will solve that problem with a joint fundraising committee, called “Trump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee.” (Not to be confused with Save America, or his Save America Joint Fundraising Committee, of course.) That new group will serve to connect the new campaign to Save America, opening up access to that valuable donor data.But that still leaves the biggest question unanswered. Even after barraging donors with Save America fundraising requests for the last two years—including through automatically recurring donation schemes and potentially fraudulent promises—Trump now finds himself unable to put that money where he needs it the most. He’ll have to start fresh, and find a way to motivate and sustain a small-dollar base that’s coming off of a midterm fundraising blitz and is already dangerously exhausted.Jordan Libowitz, communications director at government watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, explained that even though Trump wields a huge bankroll—with nearly three times more cash on hand than the Republican National Committee—Trump has hemmed himself in.“It comes back to what I see as really the most basic thing: Donald Trump doesn’t like spending money on anything that isn’t Donald Trump—and he doesn’t even like spending his own money on Donald Trump,” Libowitz said. “He loves to spend other people’s money.”Over the last two years, Trump has chosen to raise money for his personal leadership PAC, which Libowitz described as “just shy of a slush fund.”But recent data shows that Trump’s once mighty army of small-dollar donors might not be able and willing to give him what he needs.“That’s a real concern,” Libowitz said. “They’re not megadonors. They only have so much money, and they’ve been getting asked to hand it over consistently for years now.”While Trump has spent nearly all of the last two years licking his wounds at his Mar-a-Lago resort compound, he has also been bleeding his small-dollar donors dry. And it’s getting harder to convince them to part with their money. Trump’s most recent campaign finance filings revealed a total loss of more than $13 million, and every dollar he raises now is nearly wiped out by fundraising costs alone.To solve that problem, Trump’s allies have created super PACs to solicit money from wealthy backers in unlimited amounts.But that’s created another headache, because the committees are really starting to pile up.The full Trump-aligned apparatus counts at least nine separate active political committees. But because they often reuse the same names, it’s maddening to keep track of them. And all the old committees in this armada still have money left over, too—more than $10 million combined, though Trump can’t lay claim to all of it.Trump Make America Great Again (small-dollar joint fundraising committee between the old campaign and the Republican National Committee; reportedly started winding down last year; $5.4 million in the bank)Trump Victory (high-dollar joint fundraising committee between the old campaign and RNC; reportedly winding down; $1.8 million in the bank)In all, these committees sit on $111.5 million. And campaign finance rules mean that Trump’s new campaign won’t be allowed to access the vast majority of it—including all that super PAC megadonor cash.But that doesn’t mean he won’t attempt to skirt those rules. In fact, it appears he’s already trying to do just that.The first indicator came last month, when the Save America leadership PAC transferred a whopping $20 million to the new Make America Great Again Inc. super PAC (MAGA Inc.).The move raised eyebrows among legal observers, who said it appeared Trump was trying to get a jumpstart on his campaign by funding a super PAC that would support him in the future. Only problem: That’s against the law.Brendan Fischer, deputy director of good government watchdog Documented, told The Daily Beast that, with the midterms over, it is “even more obvious” that the MAGA Inc. super PAC “was never really about helping other candidates, and always about helping Trump.”“When it comes to helping Republicans in the midterms, MAGA Inc. was kind of a bust. It spent money late on races that were already saturated, and the roughly $16 million it spent may not even put it in the top 20 outside spending groups,” Fischer said, pointing out that all this was happening while Save America’s bank account was full to the brim with money he could have spent on those races.However, Fischer said, since Save America’s funds can’t be used to support Trump’s presidential run, he transferred the money to MAGA Inc.“The super PAC spent a relatively small amount in the final stretch of the midterms, and the remainder will almost certainly be spent backing Trump’s 2024 run,” he said.On Monday, the nonpartisan government watchdog Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint with the FEC, accusing Trump of breaking the law on the eve of his big announcement.Saurav Ghosh, CLC’s director of federal campaign finance reform, told The Daily Beast that Trump clearly wants to be able to use the money he’s raised for himself, but the law stands in the way of that.“Presidential candidates want to get a leg up and start out with as big a war chest as possible. It’s clear that Trump saw Save America as that war chest from the very beginning, and his legal team put together one way for this pot to be available on day one,” Ghosh said. “Unfortunately, the law accounts for not when you announce you’re going to run, but when you decided that you were going to run. So the decision to transfer all this money is a violation of that law.”Still, this all leaves Trump with the enviable problem of what to do with his nearly $70 million in Save America funds—much of which he raised on the back of the Big Lie, and can spend on essentially anything but his own campaign.“It’s really a question of what does he do next,” Ghosh said. “You can only spend so much money with direct transfers to other candidates and on staging events, but eventually you run out of ways to spend the money. At this point the midterms are over and the only thing he can spend the ads on is for himself. So what he’s doing is putting it into a vehicle that can buy ads for Donald Trump, and attack his opponents.”Libowitz echoed that point, and said Save America’s millions, which can be transferred directly to campaigns and spent on political ads for other candidates, could serve as a “carrot and stick”—to both incentivize allies and intimidate rivals.As for those rivals, Trump’s chief concern, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, happens to face a problem similar to Trump.“DeSantis is raising this absurd amount of money into his state PAC, clearly given to him by donors with the understanding that he’s going to run for president,” Ghosh said. Like Trump, DeSantis can’t put that money toward a federal presidential campaign, and he can’t transfer it to a pro-DeSantis super PAC.“No one will ever do this, but you can refund it and ask those donors to give it instead to a committee that you’ve set up for a federal campaign,” Ghosh said. “But you can’t just move the money wherever you want.”"

Almost 40 years ago, a songwriter found herself in musician James Brown’s inner circle. The relationship would nearly destroy her career. Decades later, she’s trying to solve the mystery of James Brown's death…and her own life. When she makes a call to CNN reporter Thomas Lake, the two stumble into a world of secrets, intimidation, and suspected foul play.In 2017, CNN reporter Thomas Lake receives a phone call from a circus singer who tells a wild, hard-to-believe story: James Brown didn’t die of natural causes in 2006; instead the Godfather of Soul was murdered. After months of calls from the circus singer, Lake decides to fly to Chicago to meet Jacque Hollander in person. There Jacque proves her connection to James Brown and shows Lake a videotape of a polygraph test she took in 1995 that was administered by a former FBI agent.Still struggling to wrap his mind around the circus singer’s story, Thomas Lake investigates Jacque Hollander’s role in the Atlanta music scene, learns how she first met James Brown and his third wife Adrienne, and finds out how Jacque became part of Brown’s inner circle. Jacque in turn reveals the events of one harrowing night she spent with James Brown in 1988, the night her life changed forever.Thomas Lake asks the circus singer more questions about her friendship with Adrienne Brown, who believed there was a criminal organization surrounding the Godfather of Soul that she called “The Machine.” Lake learns that both women were convinced US government agents spied on them and tried to kill them. It turns out James Brown too suspected he was being watched by the CIA during his lifetime. So Lake dives even deeper into the mystery behind government surveillance and celebrity.The circus singer tells Thomas Lake about other government men who turn up in her life, including a mysterious new guy she falls in love with named Steve. Jacque Hollander goes to South Carolina to report she’s been raped by James Brown. She also goes to Texas to visit Steve.

Lake calls the detective investigating Adrienne’s death and together they discover a clue in a long-forgotten notebook that may confirm Jacque’s worst suspicions about Adrienne’s death."
1139,aussies losing motivation,Aussies are losing their motivation to get ahead financially this year: Survey,"In today’s fast-rising prices and interest rates, nearly half (44 per cent) of Australians have little motivation to save, invest, or earn more money and a licensed financial consultant warns that their complacency may cause them to fall behind the general population.Younger Australians are less likely to save, invest, or earn more money. In a survey by Money.com, 44 per cent of respondents if they are less motivated to accumulate wealth in the present economy. In particular, 23 per cent are less motivated to save money, 21 per cent are less motivated to invest, and 11 per cent are not motivated to work harder to earn more money.Surprisingly, many young Australians no longer wish to amass wealth. In comparison to 46 per cent of those aged 31 to 50 and 37 per cent of those over 50, more than half (53 per cent) of those under 30 said they lack the motivation to save, invest, or improve their income at work.Licensed financial adviser Helen Baker says: “It is concerning that such a high percentage of the population has become complacent over building wealth. Unfortunately, the risk with complacency is that they will form a habit of not saving or investing, and it can be difficult to get out of this complacency. Individuals will also fall behind on their financial goals as a result. The longer savings and assets fail to grow, the harder it will be to catch up.“It’s surprising to see that younger individuals aren’t focussed on building their wealth. They also risk falling behind those who are – and who will likely have better opportunities and funds for the future, such as for their retirement. In contrast, the return of immigration and a more competitive job market will prove challenging for those who have lost their motivation.”The study discovered an explanation for the decline in motivation: more than half (59 per cent) of respondents think Australia’s inflation won’t be under control, allowing it to return to its average growth rate of 3 per cent.Most respondents across all age groups, States, and Territories agree that neither the government nor the RBA will bring inflation to normal levels. More than half (61 per cent) of people under 30 and 58 per cent of people over 30 believed inflation would not be controlled. Two-thirds (66 per cent) of West Australians, 63 per cent) of Queenslanders, and 60 per cent of Victorians stated the same throughout the States.In addition, Money.com.au questioned poll participants if they had changed their spending patterns this year. The findings indicate that Australians are less motivated to accumulate wealth and are less likely to spend their money; 35 per cent of respondents said their spending had decreased this year. Additionally, forty-four (44) per cent have kept up their expenditure.Particularly Australians over 50 are cutting back on their spending this year: 41percent of over-50s, compared to 35percent of those between the ages of 31 and 50 and 25percent of those under 30. This is consistent with recent data that showed household expenditure declined in September, falling by 0.5 per cent, the first drop since interest rates started to rise in April.Helen says: “While it can take several months for rate rises to trickle into an individual’s spending, it is clear that the increases we saw earlier this year, combined with inflation, has led many Australians to re-think their spending.“The RBA’s 0.25 per cent cash rate increases in October and November have sent a clue to the population that they might not be able to control inflation – or that the inflationary period will last years.“Experts predict that the inflation rate will peak at 7.75 per cent in the December quarter, but that depends on what you spend your money on. Groceries have increased by around 9 per cent this year, petrol by 18 per cent, and household energy bills are tipped to increase by 20 per cent by the end of the year. Private health insurance premiums also increased this year by 2.7 per cent.“Despite Australians indicating they are slowing their spending, we are approaching Christmas, a period when individuals tend to spend strongly, particularly on retail. I anticipate some households will increase their spending in the last two months of the year, and it is possible we will see a more pronounced decline early next year.”"
898,uncertain stardom bilal,The Uncertain Stardom of Bilal Baig,"‘Sort Of’ is one of the most original, exciting shows on TV today, and it might be star and co-creator Bilal Baig’s launchpad to fame. They’re not sure how to feel about that.By Soraya RobertsNovember 1, 2022The first time Bilal Baig discussed gender with their parents was last fall, a week before the premiere of Sort Of, the CBC series inspired in part by Baig’s life. Yes, they know they should have done it earlier. Or at least before network promos began beaming Baig’s face into homes across the country. But for most of their adult life, the 27-year-old actor and writer—who uses they/them pronouns, and identifies as queer and transfemme—hasn’t had much to do with their parents. Not only did they not know Baig was transgender, they didn’t even know their child had become a celebrated writer and actor whose first show was about to debut on national television.Baig had a feeling that coming out to these two first-generation Pakistani immigrants would go badly. It had to be done, though, so they sent a separate email to each parent, titled “My TV Show and Truth.” Baig described who they were now and outlined their show, in which they play Sabi Mehboob, a gender-fluid, twentysomething Pakistani-Canadian whose life, friends, family and gender journey are drawn partly from Baig’s own experience. And they explained that they were willing to have a relationship, if their parents were. The letter to their father was in English, and short. The letter to their mother took more time. Because their mom’s English isn’t great, Baig asked a friend in Pakistan to help translate her letter into Urdu; Baig can’t even read it in its current form. Their mom didn’t respond, but their dad did: I love you no matter what, he wrote. Baig was surprised, thinking it would be the opposite. A week later, all three met in a spacious coffee shop in Toronto’s Liberty Village. “It was a complicated moment,” Baig says. “And it was a complicated conversation.”Baig’s mom was concerned about their safety. In Pakistan, transness is associated with the khawaja sira, the “third gender” community, which has been part of South Asian culture for centuries, and has long faced discrimination and violence. Beyond that, the reaction was strangely muted. “I’d have a more interesting story to tell if they freaked out,” says Baig. “But they had kind of a non-reaction that upset me even more. No one was really trying to make a deep connection.”In retrospect, it wasn’t that surprising. Baig had spent much of their childhood feeling overlooked, the forgotten child of a harried couple too busy keeping their household afloat to bring much warmth to it. The underwhelming response to Baig’s monumental disclosure seemed like that past repeating itself. Baig has only sent their parents a handful of texts since that meeting, and the relationship remains unsettled. But Baig is at ease with that ambiguity—and their ease speaks to why Sort Of, and its creator, are so compelling. Actor and playwright Damien Atkins, a former mentor of Baig’s, says that even the show’s title is imbued with ambivalence. “It offers the notion of actually sitting in a question,” he says, “and understanding that one does not have to rush to an answer.”Sort Of, which returns this November for a second season, doesn’t rush at all. The first season’s eight episodes have meandering titles like “Sort of Gone” and “Sort of Back.” This is mindfulness television, as impressionistic as a mainstream series gets. Co-created by Baig and actor-director-writer Fab Filippo, and loosely based on both of their lives, the show doesn’t pummel you with plot. Instead, it lets its characters breathe. Foremost among them is Sabi, the protagonist played by Baig, who balances various roles: second-generation Pakistani-Canadian, bartender, nanny, child, friend. There’s also Sabi’s mother, Raffo; their best friend, 7ven; and the family they nanny for.Each character is in a state of flux, and Baig is a natural at capturing characters in the midst of transformation. They’ve spent the past decade navigating their own gender transition, as well as a multiplicity of identities: queer, Muslim, person of colour, child of immigrants. Their ability to weave that unique experience into such absorbing, relatable television makes Baig one of Canada’s most hypnotic writers and performers.Sort Of has already won three Canadian Screen Awards (though Baig refused to submit themself for an acting nomination due to the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television’s gender-binary classification system). HBO Max aired the show to critical adulation in the U.S., where it won a Peabody Award and landed Baig on Time magazine’s list of “next generation leaders.” Baig has received personal messages from people who have, thanks to Sort Of, been able to talk to their parents about gender—and others who have become more certain about who they are after watching it. The latter is ironic, considering that Baig, like their show, is so hard to define.This is what I know about Baig: they are soft spoken and not overly emotive. I know they are deeply shy, because they told me, and everyone else did too. I spoke to them over the phone and via video chat, and during the latter conversation, they wore black hornrims, yellow and pink nails, bangles, big dangly earrings and a sheer dark evening top. Their conspicuous style was at odds with their reserved demeanour. For most of our video call, when they answered questions, they looked out the window to the left of the screen. You get the impression, from how quietly they speak and how little space they occupy, that Baig would be happy to disappear. They understand how odd it is to lead a television show while being, as they say, deeply terrified of the attention it brings, but the rare chance to represent an identity and a body like theirs outweighs those fears. There’s even a 12-page guide, written by a trans psychotherapist, distributed to media covering Sort Of, addressing everything from gender terminology to journalistic accountability. As Baig told the CBC, “I don’t know that I can do press if I’m going to get misgendered every other word.” Yet their hesitations about being the centre of attention run deeper than concerns about pronouns. “I just love not being referred to at all,” they say. “That’s the dream.”***Baig was born in Toronto’s east end, at Michael Garron Hospital, and grew up in Mississauga, the third of four kids. “Most of the ’90s for me,” they say, “is candy.” When Baig was very young, their parents co-owned a candy-filled convenience store, and Baig often played with their siblings—younger and older brothers, and an older sister—in the playground nearby. That was as idyllic as things got. The business went south, and Baig’s parents scrambled for work, moving often, which meant the kids’ schools changed too. Baig’s mom eventually found stability at Baskin-Robbins, while their dad worked his way up the ranks at a Whirlpool appliance factory. He might still be there; Baig isn’t sure.With their parents consumed by work, the kids made their own fun. Baig would often take on girly roles during games of pretend; if their parents noticed, they never said anything. Baig was the quiet one, watching and listening as everyone else in this family of big personalities got loud. Sometimes too loud.The scene made Baig sad, angry, horny, amazed: “I didn’t realize writing could make you feel, like, five different things at once. That was such a queer kind of feeling.”Baig found their voice at school. In Grade 9 drama class, they were browsing the small library in the corner of the classroom when one vivid title jumped out: White Biting Dog. They didn’t know what it meant, but it sounded cool. The 1984 Governor General’s Award–winning play by Judith Thompson, set in Toronto’s Rosedale neighborhood and strongly infused with elements of magical realism, tells the story of a young man whose suicide attempt is halted by a talking dog, who enlists the man in a mission to save his own dying father. A note prefacing the play advises, “This play must SPIN, not just turn around.” What do you mean? Baig thought. How can words spin?Then they read it, and the words were spinning—the accents, the voices, the abbreviations. Baig’s exposure to drama had previously been what they call “proper English reading,” along the lines of Shakespeare, and they’d had trouble connecting to it. With White Biting Dog, they could feel the words. In one scene, a fight between the young man and his mother’s boyfriend morphs into a romantic embrace. It made Baig sad and angry, horny and amazed—and scared that their own emerging teenage sexuality was playing out in front of them. “I didn’t realize writing could make you feel, like, five different things at once,” says Baig. “That was such a queer kind of feeling.”From then on, Baig wrote a play a year, enthralled by the possibilities of drama. “Prose feels deeply intellectual to me,” they say. “But human speech feels completely emotional, and I just wanted to offer that to myself and the world.”In the fall of 2012, they enrolled in the theatre program at the University of Guelph, specifically because Thompson taught there. Guelph was very white, and to Baig it seemed like they were the first person of colour some students had seen in the flesh. Then there was Baig’s obvious queerness—the green pants, the tight shirts. They constantly felt eyes on them. And the classes were huge, hundreds of people, a lecturer at the front, Baig’s brain shutting off. But they stuck around for Thompson, who invited her students to look deep inside themselves. That’s when Baig started writing South Asian characters for the first time, even submitting work in Urdu.For Thompson’s final assignment, she instructed students to “write the story you need to tell.” It was the word “need” that got to Baig. The story they needed to tell was about their mother—how Baig felt she was slipping away because they were queer, because they weren’t religious enough, because they weren’t good enough. What would happen, Baig wondered, if they asked her straight up, “Do you think I’m a good person?” That question shaped the play, though the answer wasn’t the point. It was to relieve Baig of its weight, and let the characters grapple with it instead. That, Baig says, felt like the start of a real career in writing.The result was Acha Bacha (“Good Kid”). It’s about a Pakistani-Canadian man, Zaya, confronting possible sexual abuse by his imam, while attempting to balance his Muslim background and queerness by (unsuccessfully) hiding his non-binary lover, Salim, from his devout mother, whom he calls Ma. “YOU DID NOT TAKE CARE OF ME,” Zaya berates her, which reads pointedly once you know Baig’s history. As does the last line, in which Salim expresses love to Zaya and says, in Urdu, “Tell me everything.”Acha Bacha, which debuted in February of 2018 at Toronto’s Theatre Passe Muraille, is not funny like Sort Of, but it contains Baig’s trademarks: casual dialogue (“you’re being weird”), gender fluidity, a rambling plot, thorny family dynamics. There’s enfant terrible–style confrontation (the play opens on a blow job). Much of the dialogue is in Urdu, which gives the play the effect of inhabiting two different worlds. Damien Atkins, who met the 18-year-old Baig at a summer workshop at Toronto’s Soulpepper Theatre in 2013, advised Baig to make the language more accessible to English speakers. In retrospect, he’s glad they didn’t take the advice. Instead, the Urdu-speaking audience had uniquely deep access to the play, uncommon in Canadian theatre.Acha Bacha’s most significant connection to Sort Of is Ellora Patnaik, who played Ma, and now plays Baig’s character’s mother on the show. Baig met Patnaik at Acha Bacha’s first workshop in 2014, after they had transferred to Humber College in Etobicoke, in Toronto’s suburban west end. Baig recalls racing across town to get to the workshop’s downtown venue in time, arriving with minutes to spare. And there she was: Ma. “There was something kind of instant and right about her,” says Baig, “the way she looked at me and the way I looked at her.” Patnaik calls herself Baig’s “mini mom”—she even went to their Humber graduation in 2016.Baig remembers driving home with Patnaik from a pool party this past summer, talking about the “hybrid relationships” they have with certain women in their lives, who occupy multiple roles, as mothers, sisters, children, friends or even lovers. Baig didn’t realize one relationship could manifest in so many ways. In the pool that day, they’d looked at Patnaik and thought, I’d love to feel this with my actual mom.***You don’t do Canadian theatre for the money. Even after celebrating the well-reviewed premiere of their first major play, Baig was still living above a roti shop, with a bank account in overdraft while working as a nanny. (“Imagine me and two little white girls walking down Roncesvalles Avenue.”) Several months after Acha Bacha’s debut, when they were cast in a play called Theory, they were excited. They could stop nannying and start saving.The play was about a professor who encourages unmoderated discussions among students as a free-speech experiment. Baig played a student, and actor and writer Fab Filippo played a professor. Neither was the lead, so in their free time between scenes, they worked on their own writing projects in the dressing room, laptops open opposite one another. Every night, Filippo heard the laughs Baig got. He recognized their dry sense of humour. Several weeks into the play, he asked Baig if they were interested in making television.The thought hadn’t occurred to Baig, but they have a twisted attraction to things that terrified them. What could be more terrifying than what Filippo intended—a show based on Baig’s own life? “You know when you see somebody,” he says, “and you go: them.” It was unclear to Baig where Filippo would fit into a story about a queer, young, non-binary person of colour, but as a recently divorced dad, he was in transition too. This would be a show about how everyone is, in their own way. His alter ego would be Paul (played in the show by actor Gray Powell), the dad whose kids Baig’s character nannies, and whose wife ends up in a coma. Once that was decided, says Filippo, it was simple: “The story fell from the sky.” Sort Of’s main character, Sabi, did not. Baig had never appeared on screen, but they had seen actresses who made it seem doable—like Maggie Gyllenhaal. “I always feel like she’s playing against the words,” says Baig. That’s what Baig eventually did too.Filippo and Baig created a sizzle reel, which is a kind of trailer pitched to executives who can greenlight a series. Filippo encouraged them to smile if something seemed funny, even if the scene didn’t require it—like a commentary on their own dialogue. That smirk became a Sabi signature, unlocking the character. Filippo further encouraged Baig to perform the least of all the actors, to be the calm in the storm, the way they always were. It fit Sabi’s introversion, and Baig’s.Television hadn’t occurred to Baig, but they had a twisted attraction to things that terrified them. What could be more terrifying than a show about their life?The pair pitched Sort Of as a cross between the handheld wit of Fleabag and the queer warmth of Please Like Me. It ended up at Sphere Media (then Sienna Films) because of Filippo. “I know the person who won’t crush us,” he told Baig. It was Jennifer Kawaja, who had supported his work in the past. She ensured Sort Of’s original tone was preserved—some scenes from the sizzle reel were even recreated in the pilot.Being more familiar with theatre, Baig had to get used to how visual television is. They spent a lot of time in the writers’ room, observing. “I don’t remember being a very useful presence,” they say. Sometimes Baig’s ideas were too subtle for the camera, like an emotion too difficult to capture on an actor’s face. But Baig took note of pitches that moved the story forward, and of how to be quippier. Watching Filippo in particular, they learned how to exit a scene and land a joke. According to Filippo, he and Baig never argue, and neither is driven by ego. If they fight for anything, it’s honesty. Baig feels most comfortable sharing observations around race, gender and sexuality, because they live it every day.Ultimately, Sort Of’s momentum is not provided by outlandish characters and dialogue, but by the navigation of normal events: a breakup, a friend moving, a job lost. Baig is attracted to contrasts, confronting the somewhat disengaged Sabi with a barrage of crises—all that high-stakes drama knocking against all that low-key comedy. The juxtaposition echoes Sabi’s incongruity in this genre, as well as Baig’s, who doesn’t really like acting in the first place, or is at least ambivalent about it. Atkins once praised their performance, and their response was, “I’m not sure I should do it anymore.” They do it because they have to, because they know their appearance on screen is more important than their discomfort. Before a shoot, they go into what Filippo calls their “cocoon phase,” spending time alone, recharging. I watched them do that on set the day I visited. Between takes, in their clementine tank and turquoise cowboy boots, they leaned quietly against a doorway, alone, appearing to centre themself. To look at them, you wouldn’t know they were the star of the show. There wasn’t a magnetic field around them. It was the opposite. There was space.***What makes Sort Of so revolutionary is how little it cares about being revolutionary. While it is unapologetically queer, it never relies on exaggerated tropes. Sabi isn’t out and proud (though their best friend, 7ven, is). Raffo is not solely a disapproving immigrant mother, but one trying to understand (“If you’re not a girl, what are you?”). There’s no big coming-out moment. Nor is Sabi’s identity particularly clear, even to them. There’s no spectacle, no stacked witticisms or overbearing music or frenetic editing. Sabi always looks stylish, but in a realistic, DIY way. And Baig’s deadpan delivery makes the show’s subtle humour that much funnier. “I’m glad our kids have been exposed to you,” Paul tells Sabi. They respond, “I’m glad I exposed myself to them.”Despite Sort Of’s brevity—eight episodes in the first season, 20 minutes each—themes recur, threaded throughout like in a rich novella. Of particular importance is the idea of listening to and seeing others. The last scene of the first season shows Sabi alone, eating their mom’s leftovers. It’s a callback to the first episode, in which their mom showed up on their doorstep with leftovers and saw them in full femme for the first time—a symbol of the two finally connecting.Bilal Baig as Sabi Mehboob and Grey Powell as Paul, a character based in part on series co-creator Fab Filippo.Sort Of is not a term paper. Identity politics can even be the butt of jokes (“White-saviour it,” Sabi directs Paul). Because of its light touch, the show’s wisdom hits that much harder as it pops up in passing dialogue. And trying is valued. Not understanding and expressing contradiction is allowed, which is as fundamental to Baig as to their work. “What the world needs more of is understanding how to sit with our discomfort,” says Filippo. He describes “the Baig pause,” which evokes this idea perfectly. It would come up in meetings with executives when they were pitching the show. The suits would ask a question, and Baig would say nothing for as long as it took to formulate an answer they believed in. The discomfort of that silence made everyone listen much more intently when Baig finally spoke.I’ve even experienced my own Baig pause. A month before we met for this story, I was in the café at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Toronto, having tea with a friend. Baig had just arrived with Raymond Cham Jr. (a Sort Of cast member) and they were facing me. At that moment, I gesticulated widely and knocked a full cup of tea dramatically onto the ground. I stopped and considered it, agog, before looking up to see who had noticed. I believe Cham Jr. displayed that mildly shocked smile bystanders have when something embarrassing happens to someone else. But Baig caught my eye because of what they weren’t doing—their expression remained completely unchanged, refusing to fill the moment with artifice.“I remember that moment really clearly,” Baig told me on the phone a month later. “I thought it was amazing.”Their reaction made me feel like I had given them a gift. This is a particular talent Baig has: to make you feel valuable. It is something extraordinary that a person made to feel overlooked as a child can grow into someone who strives to ensure that everyone they meet feels the opposite. As Patnaik puts it: “When I’m with Bilal, I feel like I am their whole world.”***Before Sort Of, before Acha Bacha, Baig volunteered with Story Planet, a not-for-profit offering creative-writing workshops to kids in disadvantaged communities. Like many people, the first thing executive director Liz Haines noticed about Baig was their shyness. But she later reconsidered it as an “intentional hesitancy,” a way of holding themself back to give room to others, which served Baig well when working with kids. One of the big discussions at Story Planet was about gender. Baig’s approach was that learning never ends—and not just for kids, as Baig’s own gender expression transformed through the years.In theatre school, they shaved their head as a form of resistance against the stuffy environment. “It was all about, like, Chekhov and breathing,” Baig explains. “I was like, ‘That’s not the world I want to be in.’ ” Then came the odd bangle, then longer hair, then a full beard plus makeup, and now today: no beard, hair down, makeup and dresses. They weren’t trying to make any political statements. They were just trying to do what felt right, though they often struggled with the attention it brought. Baig still doesn’t see gender in a linear way: “I’m not fussy about it and I really wish the world would move in that direction.”This is Baig sitting in the question, as always. And it helps explain why they prefer not to be an overnight success. The slow spread of Sort Of—most people I mention it to haven’t heard of it—allows for time to reflect, and to change.“There are just so many routes available, and that makes me really happy,” they say. Maybe, Baig suggests, they’ll disappear from the spotlight altogether and work with kids for the rest of their life. It would make sense. As Sabi says, “I like how they process stuff. They don’t rush to put things in boxes.”This article appears in print in the November 2022 issue of Maclean’s magazine.

permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.comFor over 4.5 billion years, each day on Earth has begun the same way: with the rising of the sun.But earth scientists look for greater changes, choosing great extinctions or periods of evolution to mark the passing of one geological period into another.Our destiny, some might argue, first began when fish climbed out of the primordial oceans and onto the shore some 400 million years ago during the Paleozoic Era.But it was during the Holocene Epoch, after the Pleistocene Ice Ages ended, that humans turned from hunting and gathering to organizing social groups, thus forming the civilizations of the world.Some say we are still in the Holocene. But others have begun to wonder if we may now be living in a new epoch, one defined by the environmental consequences of man.This new time period, dubbed the anthropocene in 2000 by biologist Eugene F. Stoermer and Nobel-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen, it marks the most recent interval of geological time that is characterized by how human activities forever changed the geography and climate of the planet.But when, exactly, was that?If the anthropocene were to become an official epoch, it would be the first time a geological boundary could be witnessed by scientifically literate human beings.But first, scientists must come up with a start date. Some argue it began in the Industrial Revolution, when factories caused an increase in carbon emissions. Others have said it began earlier than that, when agriculture caused widespread deforestation. Still others have argued that it began much more recently, in the second half of the 20th century.Alex Wolfe, a professor at University of Alberta, believes that the anthropocene started during the Great Acceleration, a term used by scientists to describe rapid climate change in the last half of the 20th century.This is when, Wolfe said, human activity did more than just impact the planet — it actually started to control it.Wolfe is in favour of formally recognizing the Anthropocene Epoch. But in order to find an official start date for the epoch, he said, we have to find a “geological horizon.”As part of the Anthropocene Working Group, he published a paper in the Quaternary International that argued for a distinct start date: July 16, 1945, the Trinity atomic bomb tests.Although that date carries great weight in the pages of human history, he said it was chosen not because it’s a metaphor, but because it can be measured. The bomb and subsequent nuclear fallout has left radioactive footprints in rock formations that will serve as a marker for thousands of years.“We’re essentially using the nuclear test as a pageholder for a series of events that represent, in our mind, a transformation of the earth system,” he said.But William Ruddiman, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Virginia, thinks it goes back much farther than that.“[The atom bomb] is an important marker in human history, but it’s not even close to the whole story,” he said.In a paper published in the journal Science, Ruddiman argues that the anthropocene began thousands of years ago, when humans chopped down the forest to make way for agriculture.“If you look out from space at the planet, the biggest change that would strike your eyes is that all these green forests have been turned into yellow meadows,” he said.Starting the anthropocene in 1945, he said, would be like saying the Wild West was tamed when the Sears Tower was built in Chicago in 1970.End of an epoch?Right now, the anthropocene is an informal term used to describe a period of time when human impact on the planet became more pervasive. But in 2016, the International Commission on Stratigraphy will meet, and the Anthropocene Working Group hopes to submit a proposal in favour of making the Anthropocene Epoch an official time unit on the Geological Time Scale.“Right now anthropocene means different things to different people,” Wolfe said, arguing that it would be more useful if everyone could agree on what it is and when it began.“These transformations are apace, they were begun decades ago, and their fingerprint is . . . absolutely pervasive,” he said.But Ruddiman said that while he thinks it’s a useful term, he’s against turning the “little a” into a “big-A Anthropocene.”“There are lots of important changes that humans have made, and they come in at lots of times and lots of places,” Ruddiman said.The current geological time period, the Holocene Epoch, has lasted for 12,000 years. If Wolfe is right, and we’re just 70 years into the Anthropocene Epoch, then we’re really just starting to see what the consequences of human activities will look like for the planet.Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be a registered Torstar account holder.

4001,john irving chairlift,Will John Irving’s The Last Chairlift Stand the Test of Time?,"There was a time when John Irving’s madcap, endearing, and at times implausible fiction ruled the American imagination. From his 1978 coming-of-age classic, The World According to Garp, to his 2000 Oscar for best adapted screenplay for The Cider House Rules, he outshone practically every other literary novelist.In those two decades, Irving was everywhere, thanks to his signature vision of genteel alienation among the upper middle classes. But his command of the country’s arts and letters has loosened considerably ever since two airplanes flew into the World Trade Center. When the nation’s priorities changed profoundly and unexpectedly in the George W. Bush years, Irving’s idea of Americans began to feel almost quaint. His writing has never really recovered, and most readers would be hard pressed to name anything he’s published in the twenty-one years since.Now eighty, Irving appears to be nostalgic for those early days. At the centre of his fifteenth novel, the brick-heavy 912-pager titled The Last Chairlift, is Adam Brewster, a man a lot like Irving himself: a successful novelist and screenwriter looking back, at the end of a long life.Born in 1941 (a year before Irving) to a single mother, Adam grows up in Exeter, New Hampshire (Irving’s hometown). Like Irving, who once suffered a hernia after challenging his daughter, Eva, to a quarter-mile foot race, Adam’s family is competitive—in their case, the extended clan shares an obsession with skiing, which leads to many detailed pages about a sport whose finesse and strategy, along with the characteristics of various slopes from Aspen to Maine, the author has harnessed to give the novel an extravagant sense of texture and place.Irving follows Adam as he rebels against the family culture and refuses to excel at the sport. As a boy in the 1950s, Adam is prone to blaming his mother, Rachel—called Little Ray by the family—for abandoning him for six months each year in the course of her work as a ski instructor, during which she leads a hidden life with people he never meets. Among them is Adam’s father, whose identity Little Ray refuses to reveal. The only detail Adam has is that he was conceived in Aspen. Adam is, in many respects, reminiscent of the protagonist of The World According to Garp. Like T. S. Garp before him—who is named after the severely brain-damaged soldier whom Garp’s mother, Jenny Fields, uses to get pregnant—Adam feels he cannot know himself without a centralizing male figure in his life.As a child, Adam suspects his mother loves skiing more than him, and his aunts regularly deploy the sport to criticize their younger sister’s lifestyle choices and athletic limitations. For those long months when Little Ray is off carving down mountains, Adam is raised by his wise grandmother, who reads him Moby Dick, and his nonverbal grandfather, known as “diaper man,” who once had ambitions to be the principal at the local prep school but now can no longer take care of himself. His inability to speak is attributed to the shock he endured after learning of Little Ray’s decision to have Adam without a husband.The Last Chairlift is structured to allow Adam to metaphorically ride up and down the slopes of his life from his seat in the present day, looking back on the people and events that shaped him. Sometimes his stories follow the linearity of his memories; at other times, they are presented as drafts of unpublished screenplays.Adam’s vulnerability never fully fades as he grows up, and Irving steadily reveals Little Ray’s true nature as a lesbian trying to navigate a world that won’t accept her. Covering the 1940s and ’50s, an era when American intolerance still held a stranglehold on society, The Last Chairlift is in large part a novel about how people of sexual difference cover up their secrets to conduct their daily lives.Irving has built a storied career writing about those marginalized for their sexual orientation and has long described these lives with complexity. While he was once praised for addressing LGBTQ+ issues in the 1980s and 1990s—especially unlikely for an author whose books were in every airport and on every bedside table—he’s now writing in a world where such subjects are neither surprising nor radical. And, increasingly, they are within the purview of the communities who identify with them. The Last Chairlift has many similarities with Irving’s classic novels, but times change, as do contexts. It raises the question whether audiences will still come to Irving to hear these stories or to see themselves reflected in his work.Readers familiar with Irving’s career will know what to expect from The Last Chairlift. Wrestling, sexual confusion, New Hampshire, prep schools, strong mothers, absent fathers, muted characters, improbable plot twists—all these tropes make encore appearances. They form a kind of winking mythology for Irving’s long-time admirers and act as ammunition for his detractors, who feel he too often retreads the same ground. In 2005, Kirkus Reviews castigated Until I Find You, a novel of similar length, structure, and autobiographical bent, for putting readers through “nearly 700 pages of repetitive, self-indulgent twaddle.”Some people will inevitably think the same of The Last Chairlift, though Irving has remained unapologetically steadfast in his craft across six-odd decades.He has declared himself a proudly old-fashioned kind of writer who offers paternal, godlike omniscience over every aspect of a story. “Those novels of the nineteenth century were the models of the form for me,” he once said, nodding to Charles Dickens and Herman Melville. “I wanted to be a novelist like that. . . . There’s no danger in imitating a writer from another century, the language has changed. . . . If your literary heroes are too close to your own generation and your own time, there is the danger that you will sound like an imitator.”The Last Chairlift, however, arrives after a paradigm shift in how demographics communicate and how our culture organizes itself around the idea of representation. Through the 2010s, critics began to dismantle the status of many twentieth-century icons—from Irving’s predecessors like J. D. Salinger to peers like Norman Mailer, down to those who followed in his footsteps, like David Foster Wallace and Junot Diaz. Many have seen their stock fall: some due to shifting concepts of how maleness should be depicted on the page and others due to abusive behaviours they displayed in their private lives. John Irving, however, has not faced these problems. Five years ago, the fortieth anniversary of Garp saw him take a victory lap, where he was lauded for the space he afforded strong women and queer characters long before any of his alpha-male peers did.For a man prone to writing fat books, Irving has been consistently respectful of those who, in previous eras, had to hide away many aspects of their lives. A decade ago, while promoting In One Person, he began to open up about why he wrote a novel about a bisexual man who falls in love with an older transgender woman. Part of the decision, he said, had to do with his daughter Eva, who came out to him. Irving said he wanted to write books where those close to him felt seen. He also noted that he’d “always identified with and sympathized with a wide range of sexual desires. . . . It turned out that I liked girls, but the memory of my attractions to the ‘wrong’ people never left me. The impulse to bisexuality was very strong; my earliest sexual experiences—more important, my earliest sexual imaginings—taught me that sexual desire is mutable.”Until The Last Chairlift,In One Person was Irving’s most prominent work that focused directly on sexual and gender orientation. The direction proved fruitful, reinvigorating an already storied career: In One Person won him two Lambda Literary Awards, including the Bridge Builder Award honouring allies of the LGBTQ+ community.In The Last Chairlift, revelations of sexual identity are high-water marks in a story that is otherwise filled with overly long character descriptions. Little Ray’s friend Molly is just a ski buddy, known as “the night groomer,” until a fourteen-year-old Adam catches her and his mother in his own bed one night, “naked and locked in an upside-down embrace, their faces buried between each other’s legs, their hands holding fast to each other’s buttocks.”After that fateful incident, Adam’s innocence about his mother is lost, and Molly forever becomes Little Ray’s partner and lover. “When you’re a child,” Adam narrates, “you think childhood is taking too long—you can’t wait to grow up. One day, the growing up has happened; you missed it, and you’re trying to seize it after the fact.”Complicating Adam’s sense of self, this tryst is discovered the night of Little Ray’s wedding to an English teacher at Adam’s prep school, Elliot Barlow, a snowshoer he had introduced to his mother in the hopes that she would be attracted to Elliot’s small size—he is four-foot-nine. One of the few details Adam knows about his father is that he was a very small man. Almost as a substitute for gaining his mother’s validation, “I developed a preternatural interest in what passed for physical affection or intimacy between my mother and the snowshoer.”Little Ray may have only been looking for a “beard,” a man who fronted as a husband for a lesbian, but that suited the English teacher just fine. It turned out Elliot was gay anyway and looking for his own convenient arrangement. “In those days—the end of the 1950s,” Adam notes, “I don’t believe I ever heard the word homophobe. There were clearly a lot of homophobes around, but the word wasn’t in use yet. If anyone had known it, it would have been Mr. Barlow, but not even he was saying it.”By the early ’70s, Elliot would move to New York and follow through on his lifelong aspiration to live as a transgender woman, an echo of Roberta Muldoon, the former football player turned family confidante in The World According to Garp. But the New York of those days was not as ready for her openness. “The snowshoer hadn’t grown up as a girl,” Irving writes, “she wasn’t lucky to be finding out what dickheads most men were when she was an attractive woman in her forties.”In these instances, when Irving is envisioning Adam’s chosen family, he is masterful at teasing out a character’s true self across hundreds of pages, and that’s when the imposing length of the novel aptly captures the time we spend with those close to us and how, little by little, we see them orbit toward their true selves.Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals have often played parts in Irving’s carnivalesque plotlines. Frank, the eldest of the Berry children in 1981’s The Hotel New Hampshire, came out at age sixteen. There was Johnny Wheelwright, the “non-practicing homosexual” narrator of A Prayer for Owen Meany, and the trans serial killer and gay twins in A Son of the Circus. These were all minor roles compared to the space afforded to the cast of The Last Chairlift, which follows In One Person in expressly seeking to make LGBTQ+ experience the focus of its narrative.Yet much has changed in the decade since Irving was commemorated with his Lambda awards, and even more has changed since The World According to Garp first compelled readers to “joke about and laugh at our tragedies,” as the New York Times noted in its initial impressions. An entire generation of previously marginalized writers—both in terms of their sexuality and social status—has not only emerged into the mainstream but has also been celebrated by it.It’s one thing to commend Irving’s craftsmanship in his dignified illustrations of LGBTQ+ characters. It’s another to ask who we would rather hear about marginalization from: Irving or those who have struggled individually, socially, and systemically to become more visible?The literary world is now blooming with voices once considered “outsiders.” As John Self wrote in his essay “The Rise and Fall of Sad White Men” earlier this year in The Critic, “In a world where fiction is as likely to be marketed on its author’s story as its characters’, we want to hear from other people. And maybe it’s not just readers, but literature itself, which has become exhausted by the same stories.”The self-representation of such voices has found readers precisely because they are able to offer new linguistic and stylistic approaches to present their identities. Will a Dickensian novel like The Last Chairlift, still rooted in the dusking privileges of the “Great American Novelists,” appeal to those flocking to more authentic representations, or does it risk merely co-opting struggles in the name of advancing its author’s social outlook? Here in Canada—where Irving has lived in part for more than three decades—recent years have seen lauded works by Canada Reads winner Joshua Whitehead, Amazon First Novel Award winner Casey Plett, and the 2022 Prix des libraires winner Gabrielle Boulianne-Tremblay, to name a few.Such questions inevitably emerge across The Last Chairlift ’s 900 pages. In the ’80s, T. S. Garp was refreshingly different when he emerged as the poster boy for an emasculated generation of man-children. There was an authenticity there that readers saw as rooted in the author’s own upbringing. That licence of lived struggle in hand, Irving and his readers had great fun with the caricature of a frustratingly precocious, overemotional Garp as he is coached sexually and philosophically by the towering presence of his mother. The uneasy zeitgeist of sexual and social politics that cemented Irving’s reputation can still be found all over pop culture—the recent Netflix series Sex Education, which follows an awkward high schooler and his sex therapist mother, appears to nod affectionately toward Garp’s Oedipal family dynamic.By contrast, The Last Chairlift rarely feels fun in its attempts at being progressive. Irving still relies on the kind of slapstick that defined the leads of his more youthful novels, and Adam goes through familiar motions as he searches for meaning while being surrounded by a carousel of larger-than-life personalities. But the results, after four decades of weathering social changes, are decidedly more contemplative and long winded.In an interview for his previous novel, 2015’s Avenue of Mysteries, which features another aging writer grappling with memories from his boyhood, Irving described recurring manifestations from his autobiography as a catalyst for taking risks in his fiction. “I’ve always written about what I fear. Maybe the most autobiographical element in my novels is that they’re not at all about what has happened to me, they’re much more about what I’m afraid of, much more about what I hope never happens to me or to anyone I love.”Readers today may wonder if this inclination toward reuse hasn’t grown, well, a tad predictable. Where exactly is the risk in this fiction? The Last Chairlift is a wandering book held together by Irving’s steadfast insistence on microdetailing every scene to the point of suffocation. For long stretches, its only discernible plot is how Adam navigated Irving’s personal boyhood mythology to become a successful writer, which is about as navel gazing as it sounds. We are meant to spot the contrasts between life and art and make the most of those results, even as we feel we’ve already heard the answers. Instead of seizing this moment, both Adam and Irving appear to yearn for a time that was simpler in some ways and more complicated in others.November 2022

148,loan 000 buses,"Maharashtra to get $400-m ADB loan for 5,000 e-buses","The Asian Development Bank has given in-principle approval for a $400-million loan to Maharashtra government to bring in 5,000 electric buses, the State’s Principal Secretary (Transport & Ports), Parrag Jaiin-Nainutia, said here today.He was participating in a discussion at the India pavilion at the COP27 international climate conference on decarbonising India’s transport sector using e-mobility.The State will soon come out with a tender for the 5,000 buses, Jaiin-Nainutia told businessline, later. Maharashtra would follow the same model as the public sector, CESL (Convergence Energy Services Ltd), did for the recently-concluded tender for procuring 5,450 e-buses. Under this model, bidders offer a per-km price for running buses on routes specified by the state transport service — the best price gets the contract. The buses would be run by the winning bidder’s drivers, but the ticketing and collection would be done by the transport undertaking.CESL aggregated demand from five States and ran a single tender on behalf of them, due to which a bulk order for 5,450 buses was possible. This resulted in a lower per-km cost of ₹39–45 a km, depending upon the type of the bus; this contrasts with ₹85-90 a km that a diesel bus costs to run.Maharashtra would follow the same model, only it wouldn’t have to do any demand aggregation because it would place a bulk order by itself.Asked what the State would do with the drivers who would not be needed anymore, Jaiin-Nainutia said that the natural process of superannuation of drivers would take care of the problem.He said that the ADB loan would need to be routed through the Centre, which might cause some delay, but said he was confident of securing the loan.Comments that are abusive, personal, incendiary or irrelevant cannot be published.Please write complete sentences.

Get Me Out of Here!.Chris Heaton-Harris said told Sky News: ""He should be here with us voting and debating in Parliament.""He added: ""So, I know the format of the show. I do believe there's quite a lot of people in a building not too far away from here, the House of Commons and the House of Lords, who've downloaded a certain app so they can vote. I'm not sure if that's a good thing.""Mr Heaton-Harris added: ""I read this morning what he said about how he wants to prove that all MPs are human, and that's actually, you know, that is true.""All MPs are human, but I think we do that every day in our constituencies and what we do in Parliament.""The former health secretary, 44, took part in the Beastly Burrows challenge with fellow late arrival, comedian Seann Walsh, after the pair entered the jungle during Wednesday evening's episode of the ITV reality show.After leaving his fellow campmates somewhat disappointed after securing only six out of 11 stars in the challenge with Walsh, 36, Hancock will now face the Tentacles of Terror trial, which is set to air in Thursday night's show.You can watch a preview below:Hosts Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly delivered the news, after which Hancock said: ""Do you know what, I just knew it was going to be me and I still felt nervous.""Mr Hancock caused a stir as he entered the main camp, with many of the show's famous faces shocked to see the West Suffolk MP, who had the Conservative Party whip removed after announcing his plans to join the show.After Hancock and Walsh arrived, radio DJ Chris Moyles paid a visit to the Bush Telegraph and said: ""Oh my god, two new people have arrived.""One of them is Seann Walsh and the other one - I've got to go back and double check.""Referencing Hancock's role in televised press conferences during the coronavirus pandemic, Moyles, 48, asked: ""You've got to get it out of the way for me, please just say, 'Next slide please', and I'm really happy.""After Mr Hancock willingly said: ""Next slide please"", Culture Club frontman Boy George told him: ""You're really going to get it. You're really going to get it. Not from me, I mean, just from...""TV presenter and property expert Scarlette Douglas also appeared interested in Hancock, asking him: ""Why did you decide to come in?""He replied: ""Why? Because, all politicians are known - and me in particular - for being in a very sort of strict way of being, which is just not actually how we are.""Douglas, 35, then asked: ""How would you say you were?""""More human than that,"" Hancock replied.When Cleaver, 59, told Hancock he was ""a brave man"", he said: ""Well, we'll see how it goes.""Douglas added: ""I'm looking forward to getting to know you outside of everything else. That's going to be good. Just be your authentic self.""In the Bush Telegraph Douglas appeared open to getting to know the MP, saying: ""To be fair, everyone's human. We all have our own personalities outside what we are seen in the media.""So listen, Matt Hancock has come on, he obviously has something to prove, so hey, everyone's got their own reasons as to why they're here.""Mike Tindall was less sympathetic.The former England rugby player said when he heard Mr Hancock talking, ""All I heard was, bulls---, bulls---, bulls---.""Ant and Dec took Hancock's arrival as an opportunity to poke fun at UK politics and jokingly addressed the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.""I'm not sure how Matt is going to cope in camp though,"" Ant said.""You know, surrounded by people who don't know what they're doing, making it up as they go along and just trying to get by day to day.""To which Dec jokingly added: ""Evening, Prime Minister.""The jibe comes after the presenting duo also poked fun at former prime minister Boris Johnson during last year's series.Dec went on to make fun of the Conservative Party's recent leadership changes, adding: ""By the way, who am I talking to there? Who is it this week? Is it still Rishi? Is it still him?""To which Ant replied: ""I think so, but they're probably due a new one before Christmas.""The campmates soon began to banter with Hancock and quizzed him over both his political decisions and his motivation for taking part in the show."
436,europe shrinking population,"‘Without enough Latvians, we won’t be Latvia’: eastern Europe’s shrinking population","When Margarita Skangale was a teenager in the late 1970s, there were 1,200 pupils in Viļāni high school. When her son was young, the queue outside the children’s clothes shop – assuming, this being the Soviet era, it had any stock – stretched down the street.Today, there are 400 pupils in the school and of her now 35-year-old son’s class of 26, just four still live in this small town in Latvia’s eastern Latgale region, three hours’ drive from the capital, Riga, and a little over an hour from the Russian border.In Viļāni’s three-room basement museum, Skangale, 57, pulled out a sheaf of handwritten records: in 1995, the town had 4,311 inhabitants. On 1 January this year, it had 2,882. “A lot’s changed round here,” she said. “It feels very different.”By 2050, according to the UN, populations will be in decline in more than half Europe’s 52 countries, including Italy, Spain, Poland and Germany. In five – Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Serbia and Ukraine – they are projected to fall by more than 20%.Q&AShowAs the world's population passes another milestone, our series Beyond 8 billion examines the impact on some of the countries projected to have the greatest growth, as well as those facing the opposite problem: plunging birthrates and rapidly ageing populations.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Over the next three decades, Latvia, having already shed nearly 30% of its population since 1990, is set to lose 23.5% more. “It’s an existential problem,” said Imants Parādnieks, the government’s demographics adviser. “Every nation has to renew. We will not stay Latvia without enough Latvians.”One factor behind this dramatic decline is global. Across the industrialised world, fertility rates are plunging: two-thirds of the world’s population now live in countries with a birthrate below the 2.1 births per woman necessary for natural replacement.But crucially, like many of the former Soviet states, especially those that joined the EU with its right to work and live across the bloc, Latvia – present population just under 2m – has also suffered successive waves of emigration, as young people leave for more money abroad.The net effect is a demographic double-punch. “Right after independence in 1991, people left and the fertility rate also fell sharply; everyone was so uncertain about the future,” said Zane Vārpiņa of the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga.“So the cohort born in the early 1990s was already small. But then many of them left in their turn, after we joined the EU in 2004, or in the 2008-2011 financial crisis, when there was a big exodus. So now, even if the birthrate has risen, the number of babies being born is very low.”Last year, according to the central statistics office, twice as many Latvians died as were born. The birthrate may have been 1.57, slightly above the European average, but that translated to 17,420 babies – against 40,000 or more a year in the late 1980s.Nowhere is Latvia’s demographic crisis felt more keenly than in Latgale, whose population shrank – again – by more than 2% last year, more than anywhere else in the country.For a town that has lost a third of its population in three decades, Viļāni nonetheless manages to look surprisingly spruce. Its white-painted, twin-towered, 18th-century church is resplendent; the streets are spotless.But in villages around, abandoned houses dot the fields. Up the road in Rēzekne, the regional centre, vast, Soviet-era factories and office blocks stand crumbling.The local economy, once based on sprawling collective farms and industrial megaplants, all but imploded with the demise of the USSR. Now largely small-scale and agricultural, it has little to offer its dwindling population of young people.Ivars Ikaunieks, head of the Viļāni district councils association. Photograph: Gints Ivuskans/The Guardian“It feels like emigration may have stabilised recently, but things are hardly booming,” said Ivars Ikaunieks, head of the Viļāni district councils association.Covid helped a little, with some locals moving back to work from home, loving the lower cost of living and no waiting list for the nursery. But for all the regional authorities’ good intentions, there isn’t the infrastructure for big business, and there aren’t the jobs for young people.Short-term Nordic contracts, often with basic accommodation, can pay three to five times as much as in Latvia. Some, Ikaunieks said, some come back with their savings and set up small businesses: one recently opened an artisan distillery, another makes local hemp products for the tourist market. But not many do so.Of course, Latvia, for centuries a battleground fought over by Europe’s east and west, has been here before. In 1910, noted Juris Krūmiņš, a population expert at the University of Latvia, the country’s population was more than 2.6 million.It fell to 1.9 million after the second world war, then swelled again during the Soviet era, to a peak of 2.7 million in 1990 – and now stands, once more, at just under 1.9 million. “These swings are nothing new,” Krūmiņš said.But that doesn’t make the present one any less alarming. In a modern economy, it means “a smaller workforce, shortages of key and skilled workers, an ageing population, huge pressure on pensions, healthcare, social services”, Vārpiņa said. “We’re not really seeing it yet, but by 2030, it could start to become critical.”In his office in the headquarters of the National Alliance, a rightwing, nativist party set to continue as part of the country’s ruling coalition after elections last month, Parādnieks said population must be a priority.His party, he said, would never support large-scale immigration, a sensitive subject in all three Baltic states, given their postwar history. Instead, the government’s plan is to boost the birthrate and encourage more of the 300,000-odd Latvians living abroad to return home.Latvian child benefit is now progressive, Parādnieks said, so a family with one child gets €25 (£22) a month, a family with two €100, three €225, and four €400. Those with three or more children are eligible for grants of up to €12,000 to help buy a home, and a large-family card gives big discounts in shops, on public transport and at museums.As a result, Parādnieks said, the proportion of children in three-child families is rising. There are also plans to improve choice and boost state subsidies for childcare, and to reform pensions so mothers in particular do not suffer financially later in life.Separately, a scheme was launched in 2018 to entice émigrés back to Latvia, headed by regional re-emigration coordinators who advise on business relocation, jobs, housing, childcare, schools and housing, and can offer cash grants.Just under 7,000 Latvians came back last year: a couple of hundred fewer than left. Not all will stay. In Rēzekne, Andrey Glushnyov said he’d would be off again in the new year, probably to Finland, leaving his wife and children behind.Glushnyov has worked for years on construction sites in the UK and in Norway. “I did work here for a while, in a factory,” he said, “but it’s not what I want. I might stay for a good, well-paid job on a big construction site. But there aren’t any.”Some, though, are determined to make a go of it. Maija Hartmane left aged 10 with her parents, who emigrated to the UK in 2006 and found work near Peterborough.Maija Hartmane returned to Latgale from the UK. Photograph: Gints Ivuskans/The Guardian“It was the usual,” she said in a cafe in Rēzekne. “Factories, fields, warehouses. They never meant to stay, but I ended up doing all my secondary school there, then uni. I’d always assumed I wouldn’t come back, but then I had a baby, and it just felt like time.”That was in 2018. Hartmane found a job with the council, then a bank. “I’m home,” she said. “My roots, my family are important to me. My best friend from Latvia is still in London. She earns a lot, but has to spend a lot, just to live. I think I’m just as well off here. It’s priorities.”Vladlena Savelyeva, 36, who teaches English in Riga after working abroad for 12 years on cruise ships and in Greece, Cyprus and Monaco, agreed. “It took time to realise my country has advantages,” she said. “I left to earn money and have a better life. But Latvia has lots going for it.”Some Latvians, of course, would never leave. Maruta Ladusāne, 43, a chemistry teacher at Viļāni high school, has so few classes now that she also teaches in Rēzekne. Half her college friends left, but she stayed – and she hopes her children will.“I can’t begin to imagine how I’d feel if they went,” she said. “But everyone knows when the next big crisis hits, there’ll be another massive wave of departures.”Individual stories may sound encouraging. But longer-term, and larger-scale, experts say the government’s focus on fertility and re-emigration is unlikely to help much. “Population is very complicated, with so many factors,” said Vārpiņa. “But there’s no real way to fully turn natural shrinkage around. Only immigration.”That’s a choice that has, to a greater or lesser extent, already been made by some of Latvia’s neighbouring countries: Estonia, Poland, Germany. For Latvia, actively welcoming new immigrants looks some way off.Memories of Soviet occupation and forced integration have left deep scars. “I am a nationalist,” Parādnieks said. “My goal is to make life in Latvia better for Latvians. If other countries want to make life better for everyone, let them.”For Vārpiņa, that’s shortsighted. “We live in a world of fluid and circular migration,” she said. Latvia should be encouraging highly-qualified, hardworking immigrants – perhaps some of the 30,000 Ukrainians who arrived this year – to stay, even for a short while, she said.“This country has traditionally been hostile to immigration. But the war has shown that can change. Latvians have offered up their homes, collected people from the border … It’s not hopeless.”"
3642,flag company sale,Change of course at Clipper Ventures as owners raise flag on company sale,"Founded in 1995, Clipper Ventures is the organisation behind the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race, one of the most famous amateur sailing competitions in the world.The race restarted in March following a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic, with the 13th edition taking place next year.“We are immensely proud of what the organisation has achieved to support the growth of participation in sailing, whether that’s through our 12 editions of Clipper Round the World Yacht Race, sailing events, sailing school or expedition teams,” said co-founder William Ward.Ward will become executive chairman while co-founder Sir Robin Knox-Johnston will take over as non-executive director and president as they look to exit their shareholdings.Sir Robin and Ward approached FRP Corporate Finance to help find their business a new home.“With the support of FRP Corporate Finance, Sir Robin and I are looking for a custodian that shares our passion for sailing and adventure to take over the ownership, build on the legacy of the organisation and lead Clipper Ventures into the future,” Ward added."
408,stage tax cuts,"Australia should keep lifting interest rate and deliver stage-three tax cuts, IMF says","Australia’s Reserve Bank should keep lifting the interest rate to ensure inflation is contained, and the country should stick with plans to introduce stage-three tax cuts planned for 2024, the head of the International Monetary Fund’s Australian division said.Wrapping up two weeks of talks with the Albanese government as part of an annual review, the IMF’s division head, Harald Finger, said on Wednesday the agency expected “a soft landing” for the Australian economy with risks “skewed to the downside”.GDP growth should slow from 3.7% this year to 1.7% in 2023. Globally, projected economic expansion of 2.7% would be the slowest since 2001 excluding the global financial crisis and Covid dips. Advanced economies may only grow 1.1% next year.“In the near term, we think the risks are still on the side of [the RBA] having to raise interest rates more” to ensure inflation expectations are contained, Finger said. In line with the RBA and treasury, the IMF expects inflation to peak at about 8% in the current quarter.Real estate prices were already down 5% and should retreat another 10%, he forecast, adding there were “no signs of stability risks” from the drop since prices would merely be retracing some of the gains made during the Covid period, he said.“The stage 3 personal income tax cuts will reduce the personal income tax burden, and bracket creep should be addressed by raising the tax brackets periodically, including to limit distributional implications for low-income households and women,” the fund said.Finger described Chalmers’ first budget as “responsible” because it met election promises “without very much new spending”, and by finding cuts to offset extra outlays. Its “conservative” commodity price assumptions also left “scope for revenue over-performance”.Any plans to impose windfall taxes or other controls on energy prices for “short-term needs” should be carefully weighed against “medium-term objectives” including keeping a strong investment climate for the sector, he said.Not mentioned in the IMF report was the risks for Australia and wider economic growth if China slowed more than expected because of its “Zero Covid policy or in response to the real estate crisis”, Finger said.“It’s unlikely that China will go back to the same growth rates as seen in the last decade,” he said. “The global company will have to find other engines” of growth.As for the government’s climate policies, Finger said Australia’s higher carbon emission reduction goal of cutting 2005-level pollution 43% by 2030 was welcomed but it needed to be backed by supporting policy.While a broad-based carbon price was the “first best” way of getting there, “we also know in the Australian context that politically it’s been very difficult to achieve something like this”.Sectoral policies such as the safeguard mechanism could “go a long way” to give industry incentives similar to introducing a broader carbon pricing scheme, Finger said."
1779,patches coming windows,AMD: patches coming for Windows 11 performance issues,"In summary, there are problems with the way Windows 11 interacts with the L3 cache and the way it works with AMD's 'preferred core' technology. AMD assures us it is working closely with Microsoft on the issues and a Windows Update will be delivered to tackle them, probably later this month. For the impatient, only the nuclear option of rolling back to Windows 10 is suggested as a workaround.The biggest of the two issues appears to be where the latency of the L3 cache on modern AMD processors appears to triple. AMD says memory sensitive applications are most severely affected by this issue. In practical terms, affected applications will see a processing slow down in the order of magnitude of 3 to 5 per cent. Gamers better watch out though, especially those who enjoy eSports titles, as these have been seen to slow down by 10 to 15 per cent.AMD doesn't provide any estimates of the potential performance impact of its UEFI CPPC2 ('preferred core') technology not working correctly in Windows 11. The 'bug' here sounds a bit hit-and-miss, with your AMD processor's fastest cores not always chosen to chew through fewer-thread tasks. This effect is more likely to be felt where you have a >8-core processor with above 65W TDP, says AMD. With the greater number of cores, there is simply likely to be a greater performance difference between the fastest and slowest cores available.Affected AMD / Windows 11 users are probably best advised to sit tight and suffer quietly, putting the lost potential performance to the back of their minds. When the updates come, one can at least be comforted by the relative ease of Windows Update doing its thing. Mercifully, these fixes aren't going to need motherboard vendor input or updated BIOS files etc."
1466,netflix stream new,Netflix to stream new film ‘Qala’ on 1 December,"American streaming platform Netflix has announced that its new film Qala starring Tripti Dimri, Swastika Mukherjee and Babil Khan will premiere on 1 December. It has been directed by Anvita Dutt and produced by Clean Slate Filmz owned by Anushka Sharma’s brother Karnesh Ssharma.To be sure, media experts have often pointed out that unlike rival Amazon Prime Video, Netflix is not looking at big acquisitions of mainstream Bollywood films as a key strategy. The Reed Hastings-owned platform is focusing on its original web shows, films and language content to widen reach and deepen consumer engagement.Netflix has announced a new line-up of original films that it will release over the next few months. These include Anushka Sharma’s Chakda ‘Xpress, Sanya Malhotra’s Kathal, Vishal Bhardwaj’s Khufiya, starring Ali Fazal and Tabu, Zoya Akhtar’s The Archies and Kareena Kapoor Khan’s untitled OTT debut directed by Sujoy Ghosh.Netflix added nearly 2.4 million global subscribers in the September quarter, far higher than its estimates of 1 million. However, it pales compared to the 4.4 million it had added in the year-ago quarter.In the Asia-Pacific Region alone Netflix added 1.43 million new paying users.Its revenue grew 19% (from $834 million to $889 million) in Q3, excluding foreign exchange, with average paid membership rising 23% (from 30.05 million to 36.23 million) year-on-year. Average revenue per member (ARM) was, however, was down 3%, partially driven by lower ARM in India, it said in a letter to shareholders. It clocked higher ARM in Australia and Korea.Lata Jha covers media and entertainment for Mint. She focuses on the film, television, video and audio streaming businesses.

197,philippine growth upside,MUFG says Philippine growth upside has moved beyond base effects,"Buildings are seen along EDSA in Quezon City, July 3. — PHILIPPINE STAR/ MIGUEL DE GUZMANTHE Philippine economy has moved beyond the stage where any growth upside is due to base effects, Japan’s MUFG Bank said on Wednesday, as it upgraded its 2022 forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) to between 7.5% and 8%, following a stronger-than-expected performance in the first nine months.MUFG Senior Currency Analyst Jeff Ng said the Philippines may also exceed the bank’s 6% forecast for 2023, citing “strong momentum” from 2022.In August, MUFG released GDP forecasts for the Philippines of 6.7% this year and 6% in 2023.“Given the strong numbers that we’ve seen in the (past) quarter… growth could really wedge between 7.5-8% for the rest of the year, assuming no significant material downside risk (emerges),” Mr. Ng said.“There’s also some upside risk to growth next year as well owing to the strong momentum that we have seen in the economic growth over the past few quarters, especially the positive Q3 number,” he added.GDP growth in the third quarter rose accelerated to 7.6% from 7% a year earlier and 7.5% in the second quarter, according to preliminary data from the Philippine Statistics Authority.According to Mr. Ng, Philippine growth has been driven by the economy’s normalization since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.“Private consumption and investment have been very strong since the COVID 19 pandemic. And it is not a matter of base effects anymore. Since the base effects have worn off, the numbers look fairly positive for the year ahead,” he said.Household consumption rose 8% year on year, easing from the 8.6% in the second quarter but still higher than the year-earlier 7.1%. Quarter on quarter, household final consumption grew by 5.7%.Gross capital formation, the investment component of the economy, grew 21.7% in the third quarter, against 20.8% a year earlier and 21.1% in the second quarter.The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) said on Tuesday that cash remittances coursed through banks rose 3.8% year on year to $2.84 billion in September, the highest cash total since July.The strong dollar is thought to have encouraged OFWs to send more money home, where their families are dealing with rising prices of food, utilities and transport.“We are likely to see lower inflation of 3.9% next year, compared to 5.5% this year,” Mr. Ng said, adding that the bank expects the BSP to continue with its policy tightening in order to address inflation.“We are expecting that the BSP (to) hike by at least another 75 basis points (bps) for the upcoming meeting (today). Perhaps there could be another 50-bp of rate hikes for December, but we have to firm up our view based on the latest developments in inflation,” he said.The Monetary Board is expected to raise key interest rates by 75 bps today to match the Federal Reserve’s latest tightening move. The board has so far raised rates by 225 bps since May.Inflation remained elevated as the fourth quarter started, surging to 7.7% in October. October also marked the seventh straight month that inflation breached the BSP’s 2-4% target.“Inflation should start to come off as some of the international food prices start to retreat and imported inflation will be less of an issue by next year compared to that of this year,” he added.Still, Mr. Ng warned that food inflation may hit 6% this year and 7.9% next year due to increases in meat, fish, and vegetable prices.The peso may finally continue to rebound going forward as traders price in a slower pace of tightening by the Fed as inflation eases, Mr. Ng said.US inflation slowed to 7.7% in October from 8.2% in September. Month on month, the consumer price index rose 0.4% after rising by the same margin in September.The Fed has raised borrowing costs by 375 bps since March, including its fourth 75-bp rate hike recently.“In light of these developments as well, there could be some potential strength and rebound in some of the currencies that have underperformed this year, including the peso,” Mr. Ng said.“The peso could be one of the currencies that may do better than some of (its) peers next year, assuming some of the risk factors do not materialize,” he said.The peso closed at P57.35 against the dollar on Wednesday, weakening from its P57.21 finish Tuesday. In the year to date, the peso has weakened by 11.1% from its Dec. 31 close of P51.Mr. Ng also added that growth in business process outsourcing revenue and remittances may continue to support the peso this year. — Keisha B.

4340,5pm snow forecast,UK weather: Flood alert remains as deluge begins at 5pm and snow forecast,"Snow is set to fall in the UK this weekend and next week as unseasonably mild weather begins to get chillier – as further rain and even flooding is expected this week.The Met Office has warned snow could fall in hilly parts of the north of England as early as Saturday, and more snow could fall next week in upland areas in England and Scotland.After downpours this week caused blackouts and localised flooding, weather warnings have been issued for large parts of the UK over the next two days, with 'miserable' conditions and flood risks forecast.Conditions could be 'miserable' and 'atrocious' for much of the UK while Scottish highlands could also see some snow, the forecaster said, as it issued a yellow weather warning over the downpours.Meanwhile, the Environment Agency had issued three flood warnings and 43 flood alerts mostly across the south coast as of Wednesday afternoon.The Met Office's first weather warning will kick in at 5pm, covering a southeast area stretching from Southampton and the Isle of Wight in Hampshire to the coast in Kent, until 6am on Thursday.Forecasters warn that roads, homes and businesses could be flooded and transport services disrupted.Another yellow rain warning then comes into force across a large area of the UK for the whole of Thursday, from 12am until 11.59pm.This covers an area stretching from Birmingham, Lincoln and Hull to north Wales, Liverpool and Manchester, as well as the east coast up to the Scottish border.The rain brings a small chance of homes and businesses flooding, communities being temporarily cut off by flooded roads and disruptions to transport, the Met Office warns.A third warning will come into force at 3pm on Thursday until 6pm on Friday for the east coast of Scotland, stretching from the English border up past Aberdeen with similar risks of flooding, and transport disruptions.Despite the unusually high November temperatures that experts say have been brought on by climate change, the mercury is also set to plummet later this week and into next week, with Sunday, Monday and Tuesday seeing morning lows of 5C (41F) and highs of between just 9C and 10C in London.Although starting in the south-east, today's rain will sweep across central and eastern areas through Thursday.The rain earlier this week led to power cuts in 1,500 homes in Yorkshire, with schools also forced to close after losing electricity.Water also cascaded down rail lines on the Wessex Route through southern England, with trains to and from Portsmouth also affected after flooding on tracks at Haslemere in Surrey.Snow is set to fall in the UK this weekend and next week as unseasonably mild weather begins to get chillier – although further rain and even flooding is expected this week. Above: Trucks make a splash on a water-logged streetAfter downpours this week caused blackouts and localised flooding, a yellow weather warning for rain is in place from 5pm today until tomorrow for the south-east of England. This could bring further flooding. Above: A lorry ploughs along a flooded road in Kent this morningMet Office spokesperson Craig Snell said: 'The warning areas are where we are most concerned about the risk of flooding but it doesn't mean that the areas outside them are not going to see some pretty atrocious conditions.'Mr Snell said a warning is in place for the southeast because 'it has been quite wet there since the beginning of November with many places already seeing more than their month's share of rain'.He added that conditions are 'still going to be a pretty miserable evening for the whole of the south' and Londoners will have an 'unpleasant commute home this evening' but the wet conditions will have passed through the area by Thursday morning.The midlands and the north of England will have a 'pretty miserable day' on Thursday after the rain sweeps in overnight, Mr Snell said.'The rain will be accompanied by a brisk wind so it's not going to feel feel good.'But he added that Scotland could see 'two days of persistent rain' and this may result in snow falling in the highlands - although this is not unusual for November.'If you want to take a walk in the hills in Scotland tomorrow you may come across snow but for the lower levels it is just going to be rain,' he said.His comments come after Met Office forecaster Clare Nasir said: 'Through the next few days the weather remains changeable. there is a downturn in temperature so expect some chilly mornings and also the winds will pick up from time to time.'There is also a rain warning in force for the south-east through Wednesday night and into Thursday.'Through the day the clouds will come and go in land across England and Wales. Expect a few showers cropping up here before the cloud thickens across the south-west and we'll see the first of the rain.She added: 'Also expect some localised flooding, possible across the south east with some high rainfall totals as that rain migrates its way northwards through Thursday across central and eastern areas of the country.'Whilst there will be drier weather and possibly some sunshine in Northern Ireland and Western Scotland, there will be 'widespread' frost in rural areas on Saturday morning, before the country sees a return to rain on Saturday and Sunday.Ms Nasir said there could even be 'some mountain snow in the north' at the weekend.The Environment Agency also has two red flood warnings - meaning flooding is expected - and 26 yellow flood alerts in place.The two warnings, both in Dorset, are for Middle Stour from Hammoon to Sturminster Marshall and the rivers Stour and Iwerne.The Met Office said the jet stream has brought mild air to the UK recently, but Britain 'will move to the cooler side of the jet stream this week, bringing temperatures closer to average for the time of year'The warnings are due to rising river levels, which have prompted the agency to warn residents to consider using flood protection products and to avoid low lying footpaths.The Met Office's long-range forecast also raises the possibility of snow for later this month and in the two weeks before Christmas.Speaking of the next ten days, they say there will be 'heavy rain and strong winds' and may 'perhaps' be 'some, at least transient, snow to upland areas of northern Britain'.Whilst there is uncertainty about next month, there is a chance that an area of low pressure could allow 'colder air to become more established further north.'This would 'increase the chance of snow across central areas, with perhaps wintry showers in parts of the north.'It comes after hundreds of homes suffered blackouts, trains were cancelled and some roads were left underwater after rain earlier this week.Downpours in England, Scotland and Wales led to travel chaos and power outages across the country.Although starting in the south-east, today's rain will sweep across central and eastern areas through Thursday. Above: Flooded roads in Kent this morningThe Met Office's yellow warning is in place from today until 6am tomorrow. It comes after hundreds of homes suffered blackouts, trains were cancelled and some roads were left underwater after rain earlier this weekIn Yorkshire more than 1,500 homes were left without electricity and schools were forced to close after power cuts in Ilkley, Northallerton and Yarm.Almost 50 properties in Plymouth, Devon, were among the first to be hit by the power cuts as the storms arrived around 4am yesterday, gathering in strength by the hour.West Wales also took an early battering, with more than 50 homes near Tenby losing their electricity, with further outages as storms swept inland – 70 homes were blacked out near Nottingham, 86 at Loughborough, 70 near Coventry, 30 near Wolverhampton and almost 50 in Boston, Lincolnshire.Meteorologists warned that there could be chaos on the roads caused by spray and heavy rain, with flooding seen on roads in Oxfordshire and parts of London.The trains are also affected, with services on the Portsmouth Direct Line grinding to a halt after flooding on the tracks at Haslemere in Surrey.Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usualWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

5149,2022 tax year,A Guide to Filing Form 1099-K for the 2022 Tax Year,"There have been some major developments to the Form 1099-K for the 2022 tax year and these changes will certainly have an impact on how businesses file this form with the IRS.The IRS continues to update many of its tax forms on an ongoing basis, usually annually. This is done to improve the accuracy of how the forms are capturing information and to accommodate any changes to reporting.This is true for Form 1099-K, this form is being updated because the reporting requirements have changed in response to the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). The ARPA was passed in 2021 and was largely created to address the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, however, it also included some new requirements for payment transactions that are made through third parties.This article will provide an overview of the updates to Form 1099-K, who is required to file it, what to do if you receive a copy of this form, and more!Form 1099-K is an IRS tax form that is used by certain businesses to report payment card transactions and third-party network transactions. In addition to filing the form with the IRS, businesses must also provide a copy to the recipients of these transactions.On the version of Form 1099-K for the 2021 tax year, and other previous tax years, there was a threshold for transactions that needed to be reported to the IRS. This threshold was 200 transactions or $20,000 in gross volume.This has changed considerably for the 2022 Form 1099-K and assumably for future tax years. There is no longer any threshold. Businesses that are required to report these transactions must do so if they are $600 or more.This new requirement will drastically increase the number of Forms 1099-K filed with the IRS and distributed to recipients. Now that we’ve taken a closer look at Form 1099-K and its new updates, let’s dive a little deeper.The ARP also set out to increase the scope and accuracy of IRS reporting for electronic payment transactions. The goal is to better capture this information from the businesses that facilitate them.These transactions are the basis of what has become the ‘gig’ economy, where individuals can perform goods and services as time allows, rather than being official employees or contractors of a business.This is a form that is mainly filed by business entities, most commonly these businesses are referred to as Third-party Settlement Organizations (TPSO) and Payment Settlement Entities (PSE). These businesses facilitate these transactions, some familiar examples would be Venmo or PayPal.If you have made card payment transactions throughout the tax year and these transactions total $600 or more, you will receive a copy of the 1099-K. This may mean that you need to include the amount on 1099-K when completing your personal income tax return, but there are some exceptions. For example, if a friend or family member reimbursed you for dinner and drinks, this isn’t income and probably wouldn’t need to be reported.The Recipient copy should be filed on or before January 31st and the deadline for paper filing form 1099-K is February 28th. In case, if you’re filing through electronic filing, the deadline for Form 1099-k falls on March 31st.Failure to file accurate forms on time to the IRS may result in penalties, depending on how late they are filed. It is always important to keep up with your business’ IRS deadline to prevent any unwanted penalties.Before you file Form 1099-K, be sure to choose an IRS-authorized e-file provider for your business. The IRS prefers electronic filing and recommends that businesses e-file their returns rather than mailing in paper copies. Choosing an IRS-authorized e-file provider is a must, this ensures that your business files its forms accurately and securely.It is also important to note that the IRS actually has a threshold for how many forms a business is allowed to file paper copies of. Businesses filing 250 or more forms are required to file them electronically.As you can see, Form 1099-K reporting requirements have changed drastically, and this will impact both businesses and individual taxpayers. Despite these changes, businesses that are required to file this form can still have a smooth and successful IRS filing season.

Credit: MEN MediaMichael Gove has said it ""beggars belief"" that the head of a housing association is still in his job after a two-year-old boy died from a respiratory condition caused by prolonged exposure to mould in his home.Awaab Ishak’s parents repeatedly complained to Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH) about the state of their flat, which was described as unfit for human habitation.But nothing was done to remedy the problem and in December 2020, Awaab, who had suffered from breathing problems, died from respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.Mr Gove, the Housing Secretary, described it as an ""unacceptable tragedy"" and said he had summoned Gareth Swarbrick, the chief executive of RBH, to his department to explain himself.He accused the housing association of ignoring the family’s concerns and hiding behind procedure, adding: ""It beggars belief that this guy is still in office. He's coming here in order to explain to me why it was that this tragedy was allowed to happen.""Rochdale Coroner's Court heard that Awaab's father, Faisal Abdullah, came to the UK from Sudan 2016 and was joined by his wife a year later.The damp and mould in the family's Rochdale flat
Credit: MEN MediaIn 2017, he had complained to RBH about a growing mould problem in the one bedroom flat, but had been told to paint over it.The following year, Awaab was born and in June 2020 Mr Abudullah instructed a solicitor to take action over the recurring mould problem.In December, Awaab was rushed to the Royal Oldham Hospital suffering from a shortness of breath. He was treated and discharged, but his condition deteriorated and he died two days later.Delivering a narrative verdict, Joanne Kearsley, the Manchester North senior coroner, said the ventilation in the property had not been effective and that had been a contributing factor in the development of the mould.In a statement issued through their solicitor, Awaab’s family said they had been left feeling ""absolutely worthless"" at the hands of RBH.They said: ""We cannot tell you how many health professionals we have cried in front of and RBH staff we have pleaded to.""In a statement, Mr Swarbrick said: ""We know that nothing we can say will bring Awaab back or be of any consolation to his family. We have and will continue to learn hard lessons from this.""He added: ""We must make sure this can never happen again. Awaab’s death needs to be a wake-up call for everyone in housing, social care and health.""The shocking images of the damp and mould were taken days after Awaab's tragic death
Credit: MEN MediaBut Mr Gove said: ""We all know that Local authorities are facing challenging times when it comes to finance. But frankly, that's no excuse.""When you've got a situation where you have a young child in a house that is unfit for human habitation. It is a basic responsibility of the local authority, in particular, the Housing Association to make sure that people are in decent homes and all this whataboutery, all this if only we had more government money.""Do your job man. The chief executive of this organisation was responsible. He was warned, his organisation was warned. There is no excuse for having people in the UK living in homes which are in this condition.""Downing Street said the circumstances which led to Awaab Ishak's death were ""unacceptable"".A Downing Street spokeswoman said: ""Clearly this is a tragic case. The Prime Minister's thoughts are with his family at this extremely difficult time.""Clearly the circumstances in which he died are unacceptable and we will no longer stand for unresponsive landlords failing in their response to tenants."""
5165,energy efficient 2021,How to make your home more energy efficient in 2021,"A new year can bring a lot of new changes, so why not make a change, and make your home more energy efficient in 2021. Improving your energy efficiency has a multitude of benefits but the best is that you are both saving the planet and reducing your energy bills while doing it! Reading through this guide will give you 5 tips on making your home more energy-efficient!The first big change you can make to your home is changing your heating system. If your boiler is older than ten years then chances are it could be around 60% efficiency, meaning that 40% of all energy is being wasted or used to power itself. Comparing this with a newer boiler that is rated around 90% efficiency, you will only be losing 10% of the energy generated!When it comes to choosing a new boiler, you will want to see which type of boiler your home has, they are usually combi, system or conventional. You will then want to go on and choose a boiler brand and then hire a gas safe engineer to fit your boiler.With the amount of smart technology that is around today, it is a great idea to put some of them to use to help your energy efficiency. The best of which to use is a smart thermostat. Smart thermostats allow you to connect to your homes heating system via your homes Wi-Fi via a companion app, meaning that no matter where you are, you are in control of your heating. These thermostats can also learn about your daily behaviour, meaning it can automatically plan around your day and ensure that the heating is not on when it does not need to be. Some thermostats will even have an eco-friendly present, meaning that you can set your thermostat to this and it should take care of itself.Insulating your home will mean that the energy you are producing in your home, will be staying in your home, and not escaping through either your walls or ceilings. The two main types of insulation are cavity wall and loft insulation.Around 35% of all energy that is generated inside your home can be lost through your cavity walls not being insulated. To check your cavity wall insulation, you will need to ask a registered installer to drill a small hole and then he will let you know if your cavity walls are insulated or not. If you are not insulated, you will have to hire an installer to do the job. Cavity wall insulation can cost a lot of money, anywhere from £400 to £700 depending on property size. You will see a return on this money however as you will no longer be losing out on that 35% of energy.Loft insulation is also important, as around 25% of energy can be lost through an uninsulated loft. Loft insulation is cheaper than cavity wall insulation, at around £250 to £300 depending on the size of your home. But just like with your cavity wall insulation, you will make this money back over time as you will no longer be losing that 25% of your energy.When it comes to appliances, especially kitchen appliances, it is often the newer the better. This is down to how much more energy-efficient newer appliances have become compared to their older counterparts. Most appliances now include an energy efficiency rating which means that you can see the most efficient appliances for your budget.You should be looking at replacing your kitchen appliances first, as these are the appliances that will be both using the most energy and used most. Starting with your washing machine is the best way, due to the fact it will be running around two times a week. You will want to try and purchase a washing machine with an efficiency rating of A+++ as this is the most energy efficient. You will then want to look at getting a new dryer and refrigerator that are more energy efficient.Switching energy providers is one of the easiest steps that you can make towards being more energy-efficient and all you need is a recent energy bill and access to the internet. You to check a price comparison website for energy tariffs in your area. You may be surprised and find a better tariff for your area. You will then want to then follow the instructions on the screen to switch providers. It may take up to a month to switch providers.Following through these 5 steps will give you an idea of what you can being to do to transform into an energy-efficient home in 2021."
4944,swords stolen booty,Long gone silver remains missing as companies lock swords over stolen booty,"A federal court judge says the case has all the elements of an ""Agatha Christie whodunit."" More than $10 million US worth of silver ingots remains missing as a court battle rages over a theft carried out by pirates using passcodes instead of swords.A person holds a piece of recovered silver. Police are still hunting for the suspects who stole more than $10 million US worth of silver ingots from a shipping container in January 2020. Some of the missing metal has turned up in Nanaimo. (Federal Court filings)Nearly three years have passed since a cartage company left a shipping container holding more than $10 million US worth of silver in the parking lot of a run-down warehouse in Lasalle, Que.A snapshot of the moment was recorded for posterity and — presumably — proof. The grainy photograph is now part of a voluminous court file related to what happened next.This is an unusual story, but not completely unpredictable: the container and its contents vanished.And while traces of the long gone silver have turned up in B.C. and Massachusetts, the bulk of the booty remains missing as a legal battle plays out over who exactly bears responsibility.""This case has all the elements of an Agatha Christie whodunit,"" Federal Court case management Judge Kevin Aalto wrote in a ruling rejecting a bid to stay the proceedings earlier this year.""A valuable stolen cargo, a secure location, multiple possible suspects, an unknown perpetrator, and a trucking company that was given the pick-up code with instructions to deliver the cargo to a location unknown to any of the parties.""Another Federal Court judge upheld Aalto's ruling last week — dismissing an appeal from a shipping company that wanted to transfer the court battle from Canada to South Korea, the place where the silver originated.Two arms of the security company Brink's — which was hired to transport the silver from Korea to the United States via Canada — are suing the shipping and logistics companies subcontracted to move the freight.The trucking company that delivered the missing ingots took this picture after leaving the cargo at a warehouse in Laval. The silver vanished thereafter. (Federal Court filings)Those companies have denied any wrongdoing — pointing to other links in the chain of firms that brought the precious cargo by sea to Vancouver and by rail to Montreal, where it sat in a CN yard until Jan. 20, 2020, the day the container was released upon the provision of a protected passcode.According to the court proceedings, the 18,276.02 kilograms of silver ingots were worth $10,262,242.37 US — the amount Brink's paid out to its customer after the theft.Now Brink's wants to collect that money from the companies which it claims are liable.The court pleadings are as tangled as the world of maritime movement — but underlying the case is a classic heist pulled off by pirates brandishing an email in place of swords.Aalto's judgment says the shipping giant Maersk ultimately moved the cargo from Korea to Canada. Another firm — Binex — was to act as consignee, a shipping term for the company to whom goods are officially sent or delivered.The global security company Brink's is suing a number of companies it claims should be liable for the disappearance of more than $10 million US worth of silver ingots shipped from Korea to Canada. (Image Source: pixgood)""Maersk generated and released a pickup code to the consignee, Binex, without which the CN railyard could not release the cargo,"" Aalto wrote.""The sole role of Binex was to receive the pick-up code from Maersk and release it to Brink's, who would transport the cargo to its final destination in New York.""Maersk sent the pickup code to a Binex email account on Jan. 6. 2020.""The reception of that email and the subsequent access to it by the thieves are the subject of ongoing investigations,"" Aalto wrote.Two weeks after Maersk sent the code — PU #885402 — it appeared with the container number and correct weight of cargo in a pickup request emailed to the trucking company that then delivered the silver to a warehouse as instructed.""The warehouse was an end unit of a set of three older warehouse buildings that are in disrepair. The cargo was thereafter never seen again and never delivered to the proper owner and true consignee,"" Brink's says in its initial claim.""After some investigation, it was determined that the pick-up email ... was fraudulent and the cargo had been stolen.""Brink's claims current or former Binex employees ""gave the necessary information to the thieves, or worked with, or were associated with, the thieves to facilitate removal of the cargo.""In a statement of defence, Binex denies those allegations, saying the company ""performed its duties in a safe and prudent manner at all material times, without fault or neglect.""Stolen silver ingots have turned up in Nanaimo and Massachusetts. Brink's has handed the recovered cargo to Toronto police, who offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. (Federal court filings)For its part, Maersk also says it did nothing wrong, taking ""appropriate, customary and necessary measures"" to ensure the cargo was ""properly and carefully received, carried and delivered.""The court file includes an affidavit from Phil Wright, director of operations and security at Brink's Global Services International, detailing the hunt for the missing silver.Wright claims some of the ingots were discovered in November 2020 at a refinery in Massachussets. The silver had been shipped there from Brampton.Almost a year later, a single 1,000-ounce bar was discovered in Nanaimo in October 2021.""Brink's took possession of the silver that was discovered in the United States and British Columbia (the ""recovered cargo"") being 26 barrels, one full bar and three small bars with a total weight of 1,836.175 kg,"" Wright says.Wright's affidavit includes pictures of the silver, which was turned over to the Toronto Police Service.That led to a news release from Toronto police last year, requesting the public's assistance with ""identifying suspects"" in the theft of the silver bullion.A few of the $10 million US worth of silver ingots stolen from a shipping container in January 2020 have turned up, but the bulk remains missing. One of the bars was found in Nanaimo last year. (Toronto Police Service)The statement promised a $5,000 reward for any information that might lead to an arrest but didn't give any of the details connecting the case to the ongoing lawsuit and the brazen heist.""Investigators believe that some of the silver was smelted into ingots for a better chance of avoiding suspicion when selling,"" the statement said.To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

More infoMuhammad Arslan, 27 of Natal Road, Ilford, east London denied charges of murder and perverting the course of justice by concealing a body at the Old Bailey on Tuesday. Arslan is charged with the murder of 21-year-old Pakistani national Hina Bashir whose body was discovered in a suitcase on July 17, six days after she went missing. Police used sniffer dogs to locate the body in Upminster after following tracks consistent with suitcase wheels.Appearing at the Old Bailey via video link from Belmarsh Prison, Arslan spoke only to confirm his name and enter his pleas and used an interpreter throughout the proceedings.Ms Bashir has been working at Queen Mary University after moving from Pakistan on a student visa to study business management at Coventry University London.She attended her first shift at 7 am on July 11, but failed to show up for the remainder of the week.Her father called her employer concerned about her whereabouts before calling the Metropolitan Police who launched an investigation.On July 17, her decomposing body was found in a fetal position inside a large suitcase dumped in a ditch in Folkes Lane, Upminster, east London.Speaking following her death prosecutor Ben Holt said: “They located the suitcase in a small ditch and a police dog gave an indication. The bag was opened at 1am on July 17 and Ms Bashir’s decomposing body was found inside.”Reacting to the news London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""devastated"" by the murder.Hina Bashir moved to the UK to study at Coventry University London (Image: PA)"
1767,apple intros m1,Apple intros the M1 Pro and M1 Max 5nm computer SoCs,"At the Unleashed event in Cupertino on Monday, Apple's highly anticipated new computer SoCs were introduced. Built on an advanced 5nm process and featuring up to 57 billion transistors, the new chips, the Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max SoCs, will initially launch as the processing options for the revamped MacBook Pro 14 and MacBook Pro 16. Key features of the new processors include a standard 8P+2E CPU configuration, GPUs with between 14- to 32-cores, from 16 to 64GB of unified RAM, and a standard 16-core Neural Engine (AI/ML) processor. Apple headlines the new SoCs as being the most powerful chips it has ever built, with up to 70 per cent faster CPU performance than the M1, and up to 4x GPU performance compared to the M1.Apple has done a good job of summarising the charms of its new M1 Pro and M1 Max in the infographics above. Apple's SVP of Hardware Technologies, Johny Srouji, hailed the new SoCs for delivering ""massive gains in CPU and GPU performance, up to six times the memory bandwidth, a new media engine with ProRes accelerators, and other advanced technologies"". Additionally, one must not forget the ""industry-leading power efficiency,"" on offer which means that users of the new MacBook Pro 16 can play back 21 hours of continuous video, between charges, for example.During its presentation, Apple sought to back up its superlative performance claims with various charts, graphics and comparisons, but it would be wise to wait for third parties to test the various M1 Pro and M1 Max laptops which will be in end-user hands starting from a week today. Nevertheless, have a peek at some of Apple's GPU performance charts below.The above comparisons against both Intel iGPUs and AMD Radeon RX 5600M mobile GPUs are quite eyebrow raising. Again, we need to see this performance leap evidenced in third party real-world tests. It would be good to see some gaming tests on these SoCs/devices.In addition to the impressive CPU and GPU specs, Apple has added AI/ML accelerators and media accelerators to its SoCs. The dedicated acceleration for the ProRes professional video codec will be welcomed by many creatives in the video industry for playback and editing of multiple streams of high-quality 4K and 8K ProRes video. Apple claims the new M1 Max, in the new MacBook Pro, ""can transcode ProRes video in Compressor up to a remarkable 10x faster compared with the previous-generation 16-inch MacBook Pro (Intel)"".Apple reminds us that it is now halfway through its two-year transition from Intel and seems rather pleased with its M1, M1 Pro and M1 Max that it reckons ""lead the industry in performance, custom technologies, and power efficiency.""New MacBook Pro 14 and 16 laptopsThe new MacBook Pro 14 and 16 laptops will be available with the new SoCs outlined above, starting from next week. These fifth generation MacBook Pros represent a significant change, not only in processing power, but in the following key changes:"
5106,drug dealer jailed,Oxford drug dealer jailed for breaching 'slavery risk order',"A convicted drug dealer is understood to have become the first person to be jailed for flouting a slavery and trafficking risk order.When Kofie Welch, 27, was handed the court order by a district judge in Oxford last year, it was the first time a court in the county had imposed the rare form of injunction – introduced in part to tackle County Lines drug dealers.The order banned him from associating with children, owning more than one mobile phone and required him to register his address with the police.This morning, Oxford Magistrates’ Court heard he had breached the order by failing to notify the police within three days of changing his address and being in possession of an unregistered mobile phone and SIM cards on November 15.He pleaded guilty to three counts of breaching the slavery and trafficking risk order, an offence that carries a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.The justices jailed him for 17 weeks.Welch had originally been jailed for more than four years in 2019 for selling crack cocaine and heroin.Then aged 24, he was the passenger in a car that made off from police when the officers had tried to stop it for speeding in the early hours of March 4, 2019.The vehicle hit 60mph on the Cowley Road before crashing into a wall outside the Ahlul Bayt Centre at the junction of Marsh Road.Welch was one of two men who fled the scene, although they were swiftly caught. Crack cocaine was found in the back of the car.Last year, he was given a further 20 weeks’ imprisonment by magistrates in Dorset for having a banned mobile phone at HMP Guys Marsh, a prison near Shaftesbury.In October last year, when Thames Valley Police successfully applied for the order, the specific reasons the police had in asking for the order were not set out in open court.However, the force’s advocate Hannah Hinton told the district judge: “The whole purpose behind this is to avoid the arrangement of transport or potential transport [of] victims of modern slavery.”The courts frequently see County Lines drug gangs using children or vulnerable adults as runners to hand over drugs to addicts or warehouse the product.Kofie John Welch's 2019 mugshot Picture: Thames Valley PoliceThe order was due to run for three years from his release in prison in February. It banned him from associating with under-18s or owning more than one mobile phone and requires him to register his address with the police.Introduced as part of the 2015 Modern Slavery Act, the slavery and trafficking risk orders can only be made against someone who has not been convicted of a trafficking or slavery charge.In order to make the order, the court has to be satisfied both that there is a risk the person may commit a slavery or human trafficking offence and that the order is necessary to prevent it.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

53,bookings recovery q3,Sabre Reports Air Bookings Recovery Throughout Q3,"Sabre reported its best quarter of recovery since the Covid-19 pandemic began, with net air bookings nearing 60 percent of 2019 levels by the end of the third quarter, company executives said in an earnings call.For the full quarter, total global bookings through Sabre hit 80 million, which is 57 percent of the levels in 2019. Sabre chair and CEO Sean Menke in an earnings call said the quarter started out slowly as airlines faced operational challenges, with net air bookings at 50 percent of 2019 levels in July, but they ""improved considerably"" after that, Menke said. In August, net air bookings hit 58 percent, and that further improved to 59 percent in September.The recovery has continued into October, Menke said. Sabre projects fourth-quarter bookings recovery will be in the low 60s percent range. Sabre president Kurt Ekert added that Sabre would see an acceleration of bookings due to its new agreement with BCD Travel beginning in the fourth quarter and into next year, alongside its previous agreements with American Express Global Business Travel and online travel agency Hopper.Despite growing concerns for the overall economy, Menke said Sabre doesn't ""see evidence of a slowdown in either corporate or leisure demand"" and that ""fares globally remain strong."" The company reported that airfares booked through Sabre started a ""steep positive slope"" in 2021, and this year, average fares are about $100 higher, or more than 30 percent, than the 2019 baseline.Sabre reported $431 million in distribution revenue for the quarter, up 76 percent year over year. Total travel solutions revenue was up 55 percent year over year to $604 million, and total consolidated revenue for the quarter was $663 million, up 50 percent year over year.Sabre's net loss for the third quarter was $140.7 million, an improvement from the $240.6 million net loss in the third quarter of 2021.As travel resumes and the world emerges from the pandemic, business travel has expanded its horizons to include all industries including the arts, technology and start-ups.

1267,fail trump 2024,"Don Jr. and Ivanka Fail to Show Up for Trump’s 2024 Speech, Despite His Pleas","A source familiar told The Daily Beast that Don Jr., the self-proclaimed “general of the meme wars,” was busy on a “hunting trip in the Mountain West” and “couldn’t get a flight out to make it back for the speech because of bad weather.”As for Ivanka Trump—who the former president pleaded with to make an appearance, according to the New York Post—is seeking to distance herself from politics altogether. While Trump Jr. intends to be active in his father’s 2024 campaign, Ivanka wants to prioritize her family and does not plan to participate in campaigning.“This time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family,” Ivanka said in a statement shared with The Daily Beast by an aide.“I do not plan to be involved in politics. While I will always love and support my father, going forward, I will do so outside the political arena,” she added.The Post reported that Trump spent much of the weekend—which happened to be the wedding weekend of his youngest daughter, Tiffany—begging both Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner to attend his campaign event this week.While Ivanka chose to keep her distance, Kushner ultimately made an appearance at the speech on Tuesday.The White House was often a difficult place for the pair; both found themselves involved in plenty of nasty Trumpworld feuds, some of which continue to this day.Even recently, new footage emerged of longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone insulting Ivanka and fuming over Trump’s decision not to issue a second pardon for the Republican operative’s Jan 6-related activities. Notably, Kushner was the point man on end-of-term Trump pardons.“Jared Kushner has an IQ of 70. He’s coming to Miami. We will eject him from Miami very quickly; he will be leaving very quickly,” Stone fumed in the video obtained by The Daily Beast, taken by two Danish documentary filmmakers.As for Ivanka, Stone said: “Fuck you and your abortionist bitch daughter.”"
1797,2022 apple tv,2022 Apple TV 4K review: HDR10+ rounds out an already excellent streaming box,"The new Apple TV 4K is pretty much just like the last one for most people, and that means it’s still the best streaming box you can buy if money is no object—doubly so if you already live in Apple’s ecosystem.More importantly, a substantial price cut helps make it more appealing. That cut’s still not big enough to make it the best deal in town, though.When it was first introduced in 2017, the Apple TV 4K was positioned as a rethinking of how we approach TV. As I wrote then, it fell far short of those ambitions as Apple ran up against the entrenched and disparate interests of the various players in the television business. Nonetheless, the Apple TV 4K has a killer interface, outstanding picture quality, a strong stack of features, and impeccable app support.Since we’ve discussed prior models at length before, this review will focus mostly on what’s new this time around—and that starts with new prices and configuration options.Let’s address the most important thing first: This new Apple TV 4K is a better deal than its predecessors. Its base configuration has 64GB of storage, up from 32GB in the second-generation Apple TV 4K. Better yet, that 64GB model starts at $129, compared to $179 for the old 32GB model.You can double the storage to 128GB for another $20 at $149; the 128GB model also features a physical Ethernet port (the base configuration relies completely on Wi-Fi) and support for the Thread smart home networking standard.Thread support is pretty niche, and most people won’t need Ethernet, either. Also, the Apple TV 4K does not download videos (it only streams them), so unless you’re planning to download dozens and dozens of games, you won’t need 128GB of storage. In other words, the $129 64GB model is the right pick for most people.This drop in price is the most important thing about the third-generation model. The Apple TV 4K has been the best streaming box you can buy for at least a couple of years now, but it has always cost a lot more than roughly comparable streaming boxes from Google, Amazon, or Roku, making for a questionable value proposition. The new model is still more expensive than those competitors, which do an admirable job of streaming video in 4K and HDR, so the cost-conscious will still want to steer clear of this one. I’ll get into why the extra cost may still be worth it for many people shortly, though.It's worth noting that there is no HDMI cable included in the box, by the way.Samuel Axon

1890,welcome cop27 thank,Welcome to COP27. Thank You for Not Protesting,"Inés Yábar, a 26-year-old climate activist from Peru, was not sure if she wanted to go to COP27. In prior years, she had been excited for the UN climate meeting—to have two weeks to talk about the health of the planet, and only the health of the planet, with the most powerful people in the world. Three years ago, she first attended the conference as part of the Peruvian delegation, sitting in closed-door meetings where she was often the only person under 30. At the next, she chased down delegates as part of the group Restless Development and gave them personalized letters from young people who, for reasons of money or visas or credentials, could not attend. Then she would join the hundreds of thousands of people taking part in rollicking weekend protests outside the conference venue in Glasgow, Scotland. Badge-wearing activists from within the conference mingled with anarchists and instigators on the outside, hoping to grab the attention of the cameras—and, hopefully, the negotiators. “It was a reminder to everyone on the inside—myself included—that we had to do more,” she says.But Yábar was no longer entirely sure she believed in the concept of COP. There was the hypocrisy, the greenwashing, the inaction—a lot of, as Greta Thunberg put it, “blah, blah, blah.” And there was the decision to hold it in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, a city hemmed in by the gleaming, coral-filled Red Sea on one side and a concrete barrier on the other. A city in a police state that frequently imprisons protesters, where no one was expecting many activists to show up. A city where protesting has to take place in a designated zone. “Do not protest here,” Hossam Bahgat, director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, warned his fellow Egyptians at a Human Rights Watch event held at COP last week. It simply wouldn’t be worth the risk of surveillance and reprisal. And for many activists from outside the country, especially young people, holding COP here has meant it has been too difficult and costly to attend. Some funders that would send young activists to the conference have pulled out, citing human rights conditions.“The organizers don’t want the pressure,” says Simeon Kalua, a 23-year-old climate activist from Malawi who was unable to get to COP27 due to lack of funding and sponsorship. He wanted to be there to turn diplomats’ attention to drought in his country and press them on their failure to deliver on climate promises. Seeing so many activists like Kalua unable to make it, together with the limits on the right to protest, swayed Yábar’s decision to go at least one more time. It seemed all the more important to spread the messages of those absent.At COP27, young activists like Yábar inside the conference have found themselves in an odd position. Activists attending COP have always had to strike a balance between holding UN-issued badges and advocating for their causes. But the inability to join with more radical protesters, and ratchet up tactics outside the venue, is new. The result has been simmering tension at the conference, without the usual release valve of outside protest. “It’s taking the teeth out of climate activism,” says Dana Fisher, a sociologist at the University of Maryland who studies environmental protest movements. “The people who are there are trying to not get kicked out.”Much of Yábar’s time has been spent in the COP’s dedicated space for youth and children, which the UN and Egypt have promoted as an important first for the conference. She’s happy to see all the young faces—both the first-timers and the veterans with large social media followings, sometimes referred to by other activists as “the golden circle.” And she continues to think that young people have an important role in pressing delegates on climate justice from the inside. But “it’s a curated experience,” she says. A dedicated space for photo ops and talks about climate justice, as she puts it, is simply not the same as protesting. “We need both.”Occasionally, that tension has burst into the open. At the HRW event, supporters of Alaa Abd el-Fattah and other imprisoned Egyptian activists briefly rushed the stage. And at President Biden’s address to the conference, four protesters interrupted his speech, letting out a war cry and holding up a banner calling on the president to declare a climate emergency. They were immediately deemed a threat by UN security and stripped of their COP badges. Even then, they had hoped to calibrate their disruption to get their point across without losing access. “It was strategic for us to not be as disruptive as others have been,” says Jacob Johns, an Akimel O’otham and Hopi climate activist from Washington state who organized the action, speaking from his hotel in Sharm el Sheikh. The group has been trying, so far unsuccessfully, to get their badges back from the UN.Fisher had expected to see more instigation inside the conference this year. Anger at the COP process has been mounting with each year of inaction, she says, and she assumed that choosing Egypt as a host might inspire some people to register with a plan to disrupt the proceedings. That could still be the case, especially if the talks appear to be headed toward a disappointing conclusion. “The whole world will be watching whatever happens in Egypt,” she says. “My money is still on something happening there.”So far, that hasn’t happened. Each morning, small NGO-affiliated groups have gathered near the conference entrance, chanting slogans about issues that are core to the negotiations, such as climate reparations, or pushing back on the COP process and membership, which includes more than 600 fossil fuel lobbyists. Most of the actions have attracted a few dozen protesters and roughly an equal number journalists. They appear on a tidy schedule, each graciously yielding a shaded patch of the conference area for the next.“Those aren’t protests. Those are meetings,” said a young attendee from Palestine, who did not wish to be named before she arrived safely home, as she pulled out her phone to record two men, one dressed as a T-rex and the other as a skeleton. The dinosaur was set to receive an award called “Fossil of the Day,” given to the COP participant deemed most hypocritical by Climate Action Network, a watchdog group. The citation, read over the Jurassic Park theme song, described a failure to uphold basic human rights and the ability to protest on climate issues. The recipient, in absentia: Egypt. The crowd gasped. “I hope I’m still allowed here tomorrow,” the skeleton said. The next day, the prize again went to Egypt.Briefly on Saturday, the traditional day for large protests outside COP meetings, NGOs held a sanctioned march inside the venue that they called a “symbolic” action, highlighting the inability for protesters to gather outside. Activists have otherwise spurned Egypt’s dedicated protest zone. A visit to the area, which involved a lengthy shuttle ride from the area where delegates are meeting, followed by a lengthy search for the site with the help of bewildered security guards, found a barren scene. A staff member, lounging in the shade cast by a shipping container with a coffee bar inside, said he hadn’t seen any protesters there.Instead, those protests have been happening elsewhere in the world. In the lead-up to COP, activist groups like Just Stop Oil began a campaign of throwing food at (glass-covered) artwork. And during the conference, dozens of protesters in the UK and Europe have been arrested for blocking roads. Fisher expects those actions to continue escalating. Because how could they not, as the impacts of climate change only get worse? But perhaps not at COP, she says, pointing out that COP28 will be hosted in Dubai, another place where it is not possible to protest without permission.Perhaps that's a better way of galvanizing politicians to act on climate changes anyway, she adds, noting that nation-states, not international meetings, are increasingly seen as the crucibles of climate action. “It used to be that if you cared about climate, you needed to go to climate negotiations to get your voice heard,” Fisher says. “That isn’t true anymore.” That’s one reason Johns chose to interrupt the American president, in particular, at COP. “We must mobilize in our own countries,” he says.In the meantime, Yábar continues her work trying to amplify the voices of people missing from the conference. There have been moments that inspire optimism, she says, like when the Kenyan delegation stopped by and didn’t just give the young people a speech, but joined them in small groups and listened to their concerns. And she is happy, as a third-timer, to be a guide for the newbies at a notoriously overwhelming event. But the tension is still simmering. People in the youth groups were murmuring about an action of some kind, and she and her friends started making protest signs, using materials provided by UNESCO. They had not decided how to use them yet. But, she adds, they had been given free rein to say whatever they wanted.Gregory Barber is a staff writer at WIRED covering energy and the environment.

""That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone, and they want Security, which can only be gotten with a Wall.""It seems likely that Trump got this statistic from one of the conservative media outlets he regularly follows online. On Friday Breitbart reported that ""in the latest NPR/Marist/PBS Poll, about 50 percent of Hispanic American voters this month said they approve of the job Trump is doing in the middle of the government shutdown. This is a 19 percentage point increase from last month, when only about 31 percent of Hispanic voters said they approved of Trump.""Similarly Newsmax reported on Thursday that ""50 percent of Latinos support the job Trump is doing, a significant jump from the 31 percent who had the same answer in a December poll.""The poll notes that 50 percent of Latinos surveyed approve of the job Trump is doing, a 19-point increase from December of last year.Republican strategist Gus Portella said Saturday on Fox & Friends that the improvement is ""very important.""""This president has done historic strides to help the Latino community,"" he said, noting the low unemployment of Latinos under Trump.The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Maris Poll does indeed show Trump with an uncharacteristically high level of support from the Latino community. The survey found that 50 percent of Latinos say they approve of Trump as president and 46 percent say they disapprove of him. Also according to the survey, 29 percent of Latinos strongly approve of Trump's performance as president and 22 percent merely approve of it, adding up to a 51 percent total positive rating. By contrast, four percent disapprove and 41 percent strongly disapprove of the president's performance, adding up to a 45 percent negative rating.Yet the numbers are a little more complicated than they were characterized as being in Trump's boast. The same poll also found that while 27 percent of Latino voters would ""definitely vote for President Trump"" in 2020, 58 percent would ""definitely vote against him."" Fifty percent of Latinos also felt that the Trump administration was doing ""too little"" to work with Democrats in Congress in order to end the shutdown, with only 32 percent saying that they were doing ""about the right amount"" and only 10 percent saying they were doing ""too much."" By contrast, 63 percent said that Democrats were doing too little to work with the Trump administration, compared to 17 percent who said they were doing the right amount and eight percent who said they were doing too much. Fifty-five percent said that they like elected officials who can work with people who they disagree with, while only 39 percent said they liked elected officials who ""stick to their positions.""Matthew Rozsa is a professional writer whose work has appeared in multiple national media outlets since 2012 and exclusively at Salon since 2016.

1548,appalling invasion privacy,Virat Kohli 'NOT okay' with 'appalling' invasion of privacy at Perth team hotel,"""Please respect people's privacy and not treat them as a commodity for entertainment"" • AFP/Getty ImagesVirat Kohli has revealed a breach of privacy at his hotel room in Perth, from when India were stationed in the city for their preparatory camp and matches ahead of the T20 World Cup. Though Kohli did not say when the incident in question took place, ESPNcricinfo has learned it was on October 8, two days after the team had arrived in Australia.Kohli made details of the breach public via a video on his Instagram page only on October 31, after India had finished their Perth leg of the tournament with the game against South Africa on Sunday. The video, which had been originally uploaded on TikTok by an unidentified user, gave viewers a walkthrough of the room and was captioned ""King Kohli's hotel room"".""I understand that fans get very happy and excited seeing their favourite players and get excited to meet them and I've always appreciated that,"" Kohli wrote in his post on Instagram. ""But this video here is appalling and it's made me feel very paranoid about my privacy. If I cannot have privacy in my own hotel room, then where can I really expect any personal space at all?? I'm NOT okay with this kind of fanaticism and absolute invasion of privacy. Please respect people's privacy and not treat them as a commodity for entertainment.""The hotel, Crown Towers, has since apologised* for the incident and said ""the individuals involved have been stood down and removed from the Crown account"".""We unreservedly apologise to the guest involved and will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure this remains an isolated incident,"" the hotel management said in a statement. ""Crown has taken immediate steps to rectify the issue. The individuals involved have been stood down and removed from the Crown account, and the original video was swiftly removed from the social media platform.""Crown is conducting an investigation with the third-party contractor and will take any further steps necessary to ensure an incident of this nature does not happen again. We are also cooperating with the Indian Cricket team and the International Cricket Council to convey our apologies and will continue to work with them as we progress the investigation.""The ICC said it was ""incredibly disappointed by the gross invasion of privacy"" that Kohli had suffered. ""We continue to work with event hotels and security providers to ensure that this remains an isolated incident and player privacy is fully respected at all times.""Among the first people to respond to Kohli's post was David Warner, who responded, tagging the hotel, ""This is ridiculous, totally unacceptable.""ESPNcricinfo understands the Indian team hadn't raised the issue with the ICC or Cricket Australia, but they did bring it up with the hotel. At the time of writing, India were on their way to Adelaide, where they will play Bangladesh on Wednesday.Ironically, Kohli has said in the past that he finds more privacy and personal space when he is away from India, that the players can walk on the streets without getting mobbed by fans, as would be the case in India.* The story was updated after the hotel in question released a statement."
3228,robotic pill delivers,Robotic pill that delivers drugs to gut could end insulin injections,"A robotic pill that can propel itself through mucus in the intestine could enable some injection-only drugs, such as insulin or certain antibiotics, to be delivered by mouth.To be absorbed into the bloodstream, drugs taken orally have to survive harsh stomach acid and enzymes, as well as manoeuvre through bacteria and mucus in the intestine, which can rule out many sensitive drugs from being taken this way. Only 1 per cent of insulin, for example, is taken up by the body when it is swallowed because stomach enzymes break it down, so people with diabetes have to take injections instead.Shriya Srinivasan at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and her colleagues have developed a drug-carrying capsule called RoboCap that can drill through mucus in the lower intestine and disperse its load. “I was watching videos of these machines that can make tunnels and I thought, ‘OK, what if we did this but for mucus,’” she says.The pill is 2.5-centimetres long and 1-centimetre wide – about the size of a large multivitamin ­– and encased in a gelatin capsule that dissolves in stomach acid. The pH in the lower intestine activates the motor, which is powered by a small battery. The pill has fins and studs on its surface, which help to wick away and scrape at mucus. Once it has tunnelled far enough, the drug is released and mixed further by the pill’s movement.Srinivasan and her colleagues tested RoboCap’s ability to deliver insulin in seven live pigs, comparing it with insulin delivered into the gut through a tube. They found that RoboCap increased the amount of drug absorbed by 20 to 40 per cent and lowered blood sugar compared with the control group.“RoboCap is an innovative concept that aims to overcome the current difficulty in orally delivering many advanced and emerging therapies, such as peptides, proteins and nucleic acids,” says Abdul Basit at University College London.While the results are promising, more work needs to be done to examine how people with weakened immune systems might be affected, says Basit, as well as the pill’s effect on beneficial bacteria that reside in the mucus."

5154,choose business,How To Choose Your Business Name,"Choose a business name that symbolizes your brand identity and does not conflict with the products or services you provide. Once you’ve decided on a name, you must safeguard it. There are four options for registering your company name. Each method of registering your name serves a distinct function, and depending on your business structure and region, some may be legally required.There are several options for registering your business nameAt the state level, an entity name can safeguard your company’s name. The state may require you to register a legal entity name, depending on your business structure and location.The state uses your entity name to identify your company. Each state may have various restrictions regarding the name of your business and the use of company suffixes. Most jurisdictions don’t let you register a name that has already been taken, and some states demand that your organization name reflect the type of business it represents.In most circumstances, registering your entity name protects your company and forbids anyone else in the state from using the same name. There are, however, exceptions in the areas of state and company structure.Consult your state’s regulations on how to register your business name.A trademark can protect your company’s name, products, and services on a national level. Trademarks restrict others in the same (or comparable) industry from using your trademarked names in the United States.If you were an electronics firm and wanted to call your company Springfield Electronic Accessories and one of your items Screen Cover 5000, trademarking those names would prevent other electronics companies or goods from using those names.Trademark infringement litigation can be costly for businesses in any state. That is why you should cross-reference your proposed business, product, and service names with the official trademark database maintained by the US Patent and Trademark Office.If you want your company to have an online presence, you should first register a domain name, which is also known as your website address or URL.No one else can use your domain name after you register it for as long as you control it. It’s a wonderful strategy to safeguard your internet brand.It’s fine if someone else has already registered the domain you intend to use. It’s not necessary for your domain name to match your formal business name, trademark, or DBA.A registrar service will help you register your domain name. Determine which authorized registrars are safe to use by consulting a directory of accredited registrars, and then choose the one that gives the best price and customer service. Your domain registration must be renewed on a regular basis.Your DBA — also known as a trade name, fictitious name, or assumed name — may need to be registered with the state, county, or city where your business is located. Although registering a DBA name does not provide legal protection in and of itself, most jurisdictions require that you do so if you use one. A DBA is required in several corporate formats.Even though registering a DBA isn’t needed, you may wish to do so nonetheless. A DBA allows you to conduct business under a name other than your own or your formal company entity name. Having a DBA and a federal tax ID number (EIN) also permits you to open a business bank account.In one state, multiple businesses can use the same DBA, allowing you to be more creative with your name. There’s also more flexibility in terms of business function clarity. For example, a small business owner could name their entity Springfield Electronic Accessories yet utilize TechBuddy as their DBA. Just keep in mind that trademark laws will still apply.Based on your specific region, determine your DBA requirements. Check with local government offices and websites for requirements that vary by business structure, state, county, and municipality."
4748,usb4 quadrupling speeds,"Razer software update transforms Blade 14 ports to USB4, quadrupling speeds","If you’ve bought a 2022 edition of the Razer Blade 14, you’re in for an unexpected bonus: a firmware upgrade that will transform the laptop’s USB-C ports into full-fledged USB4 ports, upping their throughput significantly.Razer said that the unexpected upgrade was already supported by the laptop’s existing hardware, but that the upgrade was being made available via AMD’s new support for the USB4 standard.If you visit (and buy) a Razer Blade 14 on Razer’s site, the Razer Blade 14, the laptop is currently advertised as having a “2 x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C with Power Delivery and Display Port 1.4” ports, which would normally deliver 10Gbps on each port. Now, thanks to the upgrade, each port will be capable of 40Gbps, via USB4. That’s enough to connect a Thunderbolt dock (that supports USB4) or a dedicated USB4 peripheral like a fast SSD or multiple 4K displays. Before the upgrade, connecting those external devices wasn’t possible.Improving a laptop port’s capabilities via a software upgrade should be impossible. But a spokesman for Razer said that, “the existing hardware already resident in the Blade 14 is capable of supporting USB4, but the feature was not initially present due to software limitations. Those limitations have been resolved, hence a firmware update is all that is required to leverage the full USB4 standard.”The only wrinkle appears to be that Razer is recommending users directly contact Razer’s support for the upgrade, rather than use the built-in upgrade tools within the laptop. Nevertheless, upgrading laptop hardware via software isn’t something you see every day."
1510,gravity electric suv,Lucid teases its three-row Gravity electric SUV,"Lucid had more to show today than its less expensive Air models. The auto startup has finally teased its second EV, the long-in-the-making Gravity SUV. The vehicle will share the swooping visual language of the Air while offering up to three rows of seating that can accommodate seven people. It should also have a next-gen version of Lucid's touchscreen-heavy cockpit, and purportedly offer more range than ""any other EV"" outside of the Air.The company cautions that the Gravity design and specifications aren't final. What Lucid is showing now is largely what you'd expect, however — it's a big people-hauler with perks like a panoramic roof. As with Tesla's Model X, the three-row configuration doesn't leave much room in the back for either passengers or cargo. The rear space is ""flexible,"" according to Lucid, so you might not be stuck if you need to carry a large load.Lucid MotorsYou will be waiting a while to buy the SUV. Reservations for the Gravity open in early 2023, and it won't reach the US or Canada until 2024. Customers outside those countries will have to be more patient, and the firm hasn't disclosed pricing. It's safe to presume the EV will be expensive, though, when even the 'entry' Air starts at $87,400. This is more for customers who would otherwise consider a Model X, Mercedes EQS SUV or Polestar 3.The Gravity could be Lucid's most important EV to date, whatever it costs. The Air may be fast, but its sedan form factor limits its appeal in an increasingly SUV-centric market. The new model could help Lucid reach a wider audience, even if the clientele will still be limited to wealthy buyers willing to take a chance on a young brand.All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

2396,exemption filing returns,How to claim LTA exemption while filing returns,"With the Covid on the wane—a few hundred cases are still being reported daily in the country, the travel and tourism industry has been witnessing a resurgence. And, if you are one of those planning a vacation, you can save tax by claiming leave travel allowance (LTA) exemption.LTA is an allowance received by an employee for personal outstation travel. LTA exemption is available for two journeys in a block of four calendar years. The current block is 2022 to 2025. The LTA received by an employee is exempt to the extent of the lower of the following: actual cost of travel and LTA.The actual cost of travel is limited to air, rail or bus fare incurred for domestic travel. Expenses on local conveyance, sightseeing, stay, food, etc., are not eligible for this exemption. Note that if the employees’ salary structure does not have an LTA component, they can’t claim exemption for any travel expense.LTA exemption is available for employees and their families, including spouse, children and dependent parents and their siblings. For example, Kahan travels with his family from Mumbai to Indore by train and spends two days at Indore. Then, he travels from Indore to Udaipur by train and spends two days there and then returns to Mumbai from Udaipur . He claims LTA as shown in the table. In case of multi-destination journey, the exemption is available for the travel cost from the place of origin to the farthest place in the journey via the shortest route i.e. the claim allowable in this case would be for the direct train fare from Mumbai to Udaipur and return. Assuming the fare for Mumbai to Udaipur and return (each leg of the journey) is the same, the allowable claim would be ₹2,000 x 2 = ₹4,000 per person which would aggregate to ₹16,000 for four persons.View Full ImageMintShare ViaIn case, an employee has not availed exemption with respect to one or two journeys in any year within the block of four years, they are allowed to carry over such exemption to the next block, and avail the benefit in the first calendar year of the succeeding block.For example, Manish travelled only once during the block 2018-2021 and could claim LTA only once. During the block 2022-2025, he can carry over and claim LTA for the previous block of 2018-21 in 2022. However, he cannot carry over this beyond 2022. Now, suppose Manish travelled in August 2022, then he can claim this LTA as carry-over of the 2018-2021 block rather than in the 2022-2025 block. For any further travels, he will have the opportunity to claim exemption in the 2022-2025 block two more times.So, if you haven’t claimed LTA twice in the 2018–2021 block due to the pandemic and have travelled or are planning to travel in 2022, you can claim the carry-over of the 2018-2021 block.Suppose Kanika could not claim LTA exemption in the block 2018-21 and she travelled twice in 2022. Then, can she claim one LTA for the 2018-21 carry-over and another in the 2022-2025 block? The answer is, no. LTA exemption is available only for one trip in one calendar year. Since she travelled twice in 2022, she should claim the highest expense amount as the LTA carry-over of 2018-21. For the block 2022-25, she can claim exemption for any travels in future.Nitesh Buddhadev is a chartered accountant and founder of Nimit Consultancy."
5037,grammy nominations 2023,Grammy Nominations 2023: See The Complete List,"Go easy on the Grammy voters who must choose between two music titans for a rematch six years in the making.Beyoncé and Adele led the 2023 Grammy Award nominations announced on Tuesday, after triumphant returns to the industry with Renaissance, Queen Bey’s dance floor-ready solo release, and 30, the British singer’s soulful post-divorce record. The former topped all other nominees with nine nods, setting a new Grammys record as the most nominated artist in history ― tied only by her husband and collaborator Jay-Z.AdvertisementBoth Beyoncé and Adele, who earned seven nominations, will compete for Album of the Year, reprising their 2017 showdown in the category that ultimately saw Adele’s 25 beat Beyoncé’s Lemonade ― despite practically everybody in the room (including Adele, mind you) agreeing that the latter was more deserving.While Beyoncé now stands as the most decorated female artist in the history of the awards show, she has never won an Album of the Year trophy. Adele, meanwhile, has clinched that award for her past two albums, paving what could be a straightforward path to her third.But the two superstars aren’t the only ones who’ve made musical comebacks.Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers, Kendrick Lamar’s critically acclaimed follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize-winning 2017 album DAMN, is in the running for top awards, including Album of The Year, and will surely dominate the rap categories. Lamar followed Beyoncé as the most nominated artist at this year’s ceremony, with eight total nods.They’ll compete for in the Album of The Year race alongside Bad Bunny, who made history with his genre-fusing and chart-dominating fourth album Un Verano Ti, the first all-Spanish album to receive a nomination in the category.AdvertisementAnd never count out a contender like Harry Styles, who nabbed six nominations after reaching near cultural ubiquity this year with both music and film roles. As It Was, the lead single from his third album Harry’s House, received nods in both Record of the Year and Song of the Year.ABBA’s Voyage, Lizzo’s Special, Brandi Carlile’s In These Silent Days, Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres and Mary J. Blige’s Good Morning Gorgeous (Deluxe) round out the rest of the Album of the Year nominees.As for snubs, Taylor Swift, whose album Red (Taylor’s Version), the re-recording of one of her most beloved records, failed to pick up any major nods. But the 10-minute rendition of her sweeping ballad All Too Well was recogniSed in multiple categories, including Song of The Year and Best Music Video, among others.Of course, the Grammys don’t have the best track record, leaving a trail of snubbed artists and allegations of corruption within the Recording Academy. This holds especially true in the most prestigious categories, where hip-hop and rap artists have been historically excluded.Drake and The Weeknd, two of the most popular artists globally who released major albums this year, are once again openly boycotting the ceremony after years of frustration.AdvertisementThe show, despite falling ratings, continuing clashes with music tastemakers, and a slide toward industry irrelevancy, must go on, with the 65th annual ceremony set for Feb. 5 at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.Adele - Easy on Me BTS - Yet to Come Doja Cat - Woman Harry Styles - As It Was Kendrick Lamar - The Heart Part 5 Taylor Swift - All Too Well: The Short FilmAdele - Adele One Night Only Billie Eilish - Billie Eilish Live at the O2 Justin Bieber - Our World Neil Young & Crazy Horse - A Band a Brotherhood a Barn Rosalía - Motomami (Rosalía TikTok Live Performance) Various Artists - Jazz Fest: A New Orleans StoryCody Johnson - ’Til You Can’t Luke Combs - Doin’ This Maren Morris - Circles Around This Town Miranda Lambert - If I Was a Cowboy Taylor Swift - I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault) Willie Nelson - I’ll Love You Till the Day I DieJamie Foxx - Act Like You Got Some Sense Lin-Manuel Miranda - Aristotle and Dante Dive Into the Waters of the World Mel Brooks - All About Me!: My Remarkable Life in Show Business Questlove - Music Is History Viola Davis - Finding MeAdvertisementJamie Foxx - Act Like You Got Some Sense Lin-Manuel Miranda - Aristotle and Dante Dive Into the Waters of the World Mel Brooks - All About Me!: My Remarkable Life in Show Business Questlove - Music Is History Viola Davis - Finding MeAmanda Gorman - Call Us What We Carry: Poems Amir Sulaiman - You Will Be Someone’s Ancestor.

The company has also worked hard to build up its server network to include more than 5,200 servers in 60 countries around the world.One stand-out feature that makes NordVPN a strong contender for the best VPN service out there is split tunneling. If you’re not familiar, split tunneling is the ability to whitelist some activities (such as gaming or streaming) to bypass the VPN and use the regular “clearnet” for better performance.From protected DNS queries to a kill switch feature that automatically disables your connection when you lose sync with the VPN server, NordVPN wants you to know that your information won’t fall into the wrong hands. It’s also one of the most open VPNs about exactly what servers it offers in what countries, and provides 24/7 live chat support for questions.The company has recently improved its platform support, adding dedicated apps for iOS and Android and thus overcoming its one weakness. You can also use it on six devices simultaneously. The NordVPN client provided one of the most attractive interfaces, and connecting to a server is straightforward and very quick, so much so it’s one of our top picks for the best Chrome VPN extension.It’s also available for a host of devices and made our list for the best Fire TV Stick VPN. NordVPN can be installed in a VPN router as well, which expands the list of supported devices to include Chromecast, Raspberry Pi, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Fire TV (in other words, anything connected to your VPN router). During our testing, we also found it to be the fastest VPN in our NordVPN vs ExpressVPN comparison, so if it’s speed you’re after, look no further.Country of registration: British Virgin IslandsCost: $13 per month; $60 for six months; $100 per year (plus three free months)ExpressVPN’s “#1 Trusted Leader in VPN” claim may be a bit difficult to prove, but the service offers a compelling list of features nonetheless. It also constantly tries to make regular improvements in speed and simultaneous streaming capabilities, and with support for all major platforms (Windows, MacOS, Android, etc.), you won’t need to worry about compatibility. ExpressVPN shows up on a number of best VPN lists, including our list of the best VPN for Linux and the best VPN for Windows, so its relatively high prices seem justified.The more than 3,000 servers are all well placed throughout common travel destinations and urban centers. Any package will land you high-speed unlimited bandwidth and 24-hour customer service. With so many features, including bypassing ISP throttling, built-in threat protection, and split tunneling, it’s no wonder this vendor is considered the best VPN by many users — although you should note that ExpressVPN only supports up to five simultaneous connections with a single subscription, which is the lowest number of the services on our list.But they also provide a workaround of sorts for that: If you install ExpressVPN on your router, your router can protect all of your devices (as the router itself only counts as one device towards your subscription), regardless of how many other devices are connected to that network hub. This way, you can have well more than five devices protected at once.Setting up ExpressVPN and connecting to a VPN server was easy enough. Netflix complained about a proxy in use when we used the automatic configuration option, but it worked fine when we manually selected a local U.S. server, so it’s a working Netflix VPN. Amazon Prime Video played just fine, and our other internet tests were completed without issue.It may not quite rank as the best VPN, but when it comes to price, Surfshark is hard to beat and is a great option for those looking to protect their privacy while minimizing costs. Surfshark is available for as cheaply as $53 for the two-year plan, and to sweeten the deal even more, that includes an unlimited number of simultaneous connections.Feature-wise, Surfshark is fairly basic. This isn’t necessarily a problem if you don’t need any bells and whistles and just want a solid VPN on the cheap. In fact, the simple, no-nonsense interface, intuitive setup, and simple operation could easily be selling points if you explicitly don’t want to fuss with unnecessary complications. It supports a host of different devices, and it’s one of our top picks for the best Apple TV VPN, too.That’s not to say it’s completely bare-bones, though; you get multiple encryption protocols to choose from (OpenVPN UDP or TCP, IKEv2/IPsec, and WireGuard) and a double VPN hop that lets you route your connection through two remote servers instead of one, adding an extra layer of security when desired.Surfshark also works quite well with streaming services, although its speeds aren’t quite as good as other top VPN services like NordVPN and ExpressVPN. All in all, though, it’s the best VPN of 2022 for those on a budget, and especially for larger local networks such as family homes and offices.Country of registration: United StatesCost: $11 per month, $30 per quarter, $48 for the first year (plus three free months)IPVanish offers all the key features you could need from a VPN at a great price. With regular sales being part of the IPVanish experience, you can commit for a year at a very low cost, enjoying the protection that comes from a choice of more than 2,000 VPN servers across more than 75 different locations.Besides offering extensive protection whether you’re browsing from home or using a public Wi-Fi hotspot, IPVanish also makes it simpler to avoid Deep Packet Inspection — a method used by ISPs to limit your internet speed at times. The VPN offers unmetered data transfer caps and there’s no limit on how many devices you can use it with so it’s incredibly flexible for high-volume users and larger local networks.No logs are kept, plus there’s a choice of multiple connection protocols which is useful if you want to get more involved in your VPN settings. 24/7 customer support means the VPN is always on hand to help you out, too. Not that you should need it too often thanks to simple-to-use apps for all major platforms. It’s a great service and it’ll even help you avoid geo-restrictions on many of your favorite streaming apps.Country of registration: United StatesCost: $11 per month; $40 for the first year; $72 for the first three years (plus three free months)AtlasVPN is a newcomer to the VPN industry, but it comes packed with secure and steadfast features that challenge even the big players. What’s amazing about this VPN is that it has a comprehensive free data plan that is one of the best on the market, and if you decide to upgrade to the faster, premium servers, then it only costs $40 per year or $72 for three years. While the server network may be considerably smaller than its competitors, it is a newer service with much more room to expand.In terms of security, although the service is young, it didn’t cut any corners when constructing the server security. You can feel comfortable knowing you’re protected behind 256-bit encryption, WireGuard protocols, IPv6 leak protection, and a whole host of other features. Whether you’re browsing the internet casually, conducting important transactions, gaming, or streaming, you’ll find that AtlasVPN’s servers are ideal for you.What’s more, Atlas now offers SafeSwap servers, a brand new feature that enhances anonymity and security. With SafeSwap, you can rotate IP addresses without ever having to swap between VPN servers. As of now, AtlasVPN is the only provider that offers something like this. SafeSwap draws from a pool of IP addresses with outgoing traffic routed to the various addresses, yet you’ll experience no decrease in speeds — that’s super important if you’re streaming.Last, but certainly not least, you can use AtlasVPN on all of your devices (if the client supports the VPN) and keep yourself protected wherever you are. With unlimited simultaneous connections, you don’t need to worry about getting booted off the VPN in case you reach the limit. The application is easy to install on all devices that even your grandparents could use AtlasVPN and stay protected online. The free data plan can help accommodate you or your family members to VPN services to better understand the inner workings of staying safe online.Speed can be a limiting factor with even the best VPN, and Hotspot Shield — a relatively new player in the virtual private network space — sought to make that problem its main focus. With up to gigabit speeds, we can safely say that Hotspot Shield seems to have succeeded in that endeavor.The virtual private network was named the fasted VPN in 2019 and 2020 by Speedtest.net, too, so that doesn’t appear to be mere marketing. But Hotspot Shield isn’t a one-trick pony and has more to offer than just fast speeds. Its list of features also includes military-grade encryption and unlimited bandwidth (at gigabit speeds, mind you).Hotspot Shield is also very simple to set up and use, but we’d like to see a little more customization options, such as control over encryption protocols. This is part of the deal you get with this VPN, though, as Hotspot Shield utilizes its own proprietary “Hydra” encryption protocol which the company claims is what makes it so fast. That’s just the nature of this beast, it seems.Another consideration, and a potential drawback, is that as with ExpressVPN, you’re limited to five simultaneous connections per subscription. If you accept these limitations and can deal with some compromises in favor of speed, though — perhaps you’re looking for the best VPN for gaming or the best VPN for Kodi — then Hotspot Shield is an excellent choice that lives up to its promise of speed.And in the event that you find it’s still not snappy enough for your digital lifestyle, Hotspot Shield also offers a VPN free trial. New subscribers get an extended 45-day money-back refund period, which is the most generous guarantee on our list. There’s also a free VPN plan, although speeds are capped at 2Mbps.With VPNs, it’s all about location, location, location. PrivadoVPN is a Swiss company and is thus free from the laws of the U.S. and the European Union. Switzerland has pretty robust privacy laws, as well. It’s also not a member of the “fourteen eyes surveillance network,” so user traffic isn’t logged and passes through privacy-friendly countries. That means you needn’t worry about your true IP address being revealed.Interestingly, PrivadoVPN operates one of the smaller server networks of all the providers on our list, measuring in at more than 320 servers spread between 58 physical locations in 47 countries, but that doesn’t preclude it from being a contender for the best VPN of 2022. That’s because it only offers physical server locations not virtual ones because it is not willing to compromise the quality of its service so it can promote a higher number.If routing around region-based content restrictions and other geographical hassles is your priority, you might be better served with a VPN that has a wider global server spread, such as ExpressVPN. Although, having said that, PrivadoVPN is a fraction of the cost and covers a large chunk of countries, so if the one you’re wanting to virtually jump to is on its list, then we’d recommend taking it for a spin.PrivadoVPN has it where it counts, though, with several encryption protocols to choose from: OpenVPN, IKEv2, and SOCKS5. The addition of SOCKS5 proxy support is noteworthy, as it allows for fast and seamless peer-to-peer transferring of large files, which is something many VPNs shy away from. This makes PrivadoVPN perhaps the best VPN service for peer-to-peer file transfers if that’s your primary use case for one of these services.It’s a little more expensive than some others at $8 per month or $60 for the first year (which comes to $5 per month on average), although that’s offset by the fact that you can use the VPN on up to ten devices simultaneously. There’s also a free app-based package that gives you 10GB of bandwidth per month.CyberghostCountry of registration: RomaniaCost: $13 per month; $42 for six months; $57 for the first two years (plus four free months)With more than ten million active users and over 7,000 servers spread across the globe, CyberGhost is a giant in the VPN space. It’s also one of the most versatile virtual private networks out there, both in terms of supported devices/platforms as well as what activities it’s useful for.CyberGhost VPN is compatible with computers, mobile devices, smart TVs, and even gaming consoles, and one great feature of the VPN is that it will automatically connect you to the best server for whatever you’re doing at the moment. That’s a vital consideration for bandwidth-heavy activities like gaming and streaming.Another feather in the CyberGhost cap is that it supports peer-to-peer file transfers (read: It’s good to go for torrenting, and as we mentioned, it’ll select the best server for it so you get the fastest upload/download times). The interface is great, too, particularly on the computer. It gives you complete control and lots of configuration options including preferred server setups for your most-used programs and apps.For encryption protocols, CyberGhost supports OpenVPN, IKEv2, and WireGuard, wrapping your connection in AES 256-bit encryption to keep your data and IP address hidden. CyberGhost is based in Romania and has a no-logs policy, and while this should keep you safe from certain prying eyes, this hasn’t been independently audited.If that’s not a deal-breaker, CyberGhost is a strong contender for the best VPN of 2022 (take a look at our NordVPN vs CyberGhost comparison for more information on how it stacks up to the best) if you’re looking for the sweet spot between versatility and price. A limited-time introductory offer lets new subscribers grab their first two years of service for $57, which averages to just over $2 per month.Country of registration: Hong KongCost: $11 per month; $39 for the first year; $47 for the first two years (plus three free months)With a name like PureVPN, this virtual private network had better offer some viable protection — and it does. The software’s hallmarks lie in its ability to connect to a mélange of services for different activities, with wide compatibility with various devices and software interfaces.The service runs from $11 for one month to $47 for two years, making PureVPN another one of the best cheap VPNs on our roundup. That subscription includes port forwarding, multiple encryption protocols (PPTP, SSTP, L2TP/IPSec, IKEv2, and OpenVPN UDP/TCP), malware blocking, P2P support, and an audited no-log policy.As with any good virtual private network service, PureVPN will prevent websites from viewing your personal IP address, thus preventing others from identifying you or your geographic location. And with more than 6,500 servers on six continents, you won’t be at a loss for worldwide connection points to choose from.Like NordVPN, PureVPN features split tunneling that allows you to whitelist certain activities you don’t need or want to go through the VPN, allowing you to use online services and browse the web through the VPN and on the clearnet simultaneously. PureVPN also offers you a personal IP address for you to use with certain sites and services — a good idea for those that require logins.Country of registration: CanadaCost: $10 per month; $60 per year; $120 for three yearsNumber of servers & locations: 1,000+, 49 countriesClients supported: Windows, MacOS, iOS, AndroidNumber of simultaneous connections: Up to fiveSpecial features: Free data-capped basic plan availableOur second-to-last pick isn’t as feature-rich as the others listed on our best VPN of 2022 roundup, but it’s nonetheless worth a mention if you’re looking for another no-frills (read: cheap) virtual private network that doesn’t bog you down with features you don’t need. TunnelBear puts ease of use and newbie-friendliness front and center. If you’re new to VPNs and find all this a bit intimidating, this big bear might be the one for you.The main appeal of TunnelBear is simplicity and ease of use. You don’t have to fuss around with choosing encryption protocols or any other complicated setup. That’s bad news for advanced users who want more control and customization options, but it’s great for average folks who don’t want or need all that stuff getting in the way. TunnelBear does what it needs to do with good encryption, a kill-switch, and a no-logging policy, with the added benefit of full yearly independent audits that the company releases to the public.That simplicity does, however, bring a couple of bear-sized caveats. Firstly, there’s no free VPN trial or money-back guarantee, which could be a non-starter for many who are new to the VPN game and don’t want to fully commit to a service right away. If this describes you, you’re probably better served with a VPN that has a 30- to 45-day refund period.On the other hand, TunnelBear does have a limited free plan that stands in as a trial of sorts, but that won’t give you a good feel for what the VPN can actually do. The second drawback with TunnelBear — and this could be a doozy, depending on your needs — is that it’s not really optimized for streaming (and you can forget gaming). The server network is also relatively small.If you can live with those limitations, though, then TunnelBear is a reliable and extremely user-friendly VPN that gets the job done for web browsing, online work, and general internet use. It’s one of the cheaper picks, too, so long as you spring for the $120 three-year plan which averages to $3.33 per month.Country of registration: United StatesCost: $12 per month; $40 per year; $79 for the first three years (plus three free months)Private Internet Access does everything you could want from a good VPN. It hides your IP address, protects your information, and scrambles your browsing activity using a variety of encryption methods including OpenVPN and Wireguard. Private Internet Access also has one of the largest numbers and selections of servers of all the VPN providers on our roundup.The PIA client source code is also publicly available, leaving no doubts about how the software works (or whether or not there are any backdoors or other nasties lurking in the code). Other nice features include split tunneling, a kill switch in the event of a dropped connection, dedicated IP addresses, and anonymous payments when making online purchases.We tested Private Internet Access using its Windows installer, which configures the VPN protocols and provides a simple utility in the taskbar to turn the VPN connection on and off. While the interface was spartan, the performance was excellent. Our test system consistently maintained over 110Mbps download and 19Mbps upload speeds with the VPN connection turned on, very close to our usual 125Mbps download and 20Mbps upload speeds.On the downside, Netflix complained about a proxy and Amazon Prime Video wouldn’t play due to a geographical restriction. These errors occurred whether we used the automatic setting or selected a local U.S.-based server. However, Private Internet Access claims that users can get “unrestricted access to all the content you want” since their VPN service supports Netflix and “all other major streaming services.”Country of registration: RussiaCost: $5 per month; $15 per yearNumber of servers & locations: 2,000+ across 30+ countriesClients supported: Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Android, VPN routersNumber of simultaneous connections: 5Special features: Free data client with up to 300MB per day, per device; unlimited traffic and streaming support with premium version.For those looking for an affordable VPN option that hides your IP address well and protects you online, then Kaspersky VPN Secure Connection might be for you. You can get a full year subscription of Kaspersky for only $15 right now (50% off its normal price), or $5 per month.What’s perhaps even more enticing is the free data service that Kaspersky VPN provides its customers. If you’re unsure about how VPNs work and want to test one out before you commit to a subscription, then you can utilize the free data service first. While there may be other providers that gift users more megabytes per month, the benefit of using Kaspersky’s VPN is the combination of its free service as well as its cheap monthly price. There’s even a 30-day money back guarantee for the premium product if it’s not a fit.Secure Connection has outperformed nearly all others in independent speed testing, making it a great companion for gaming, streaming, torrenting and downloading. It has recently added support for popular streaming platforms, and you can also now connect your router and other devices directly to the VPN to protect your entire network.All in all, if you’re looking for a comprehensive service that gives you strong privacy protection, then Kaspersky is an affordable option you can utilize for digital anonymity. It has industry-standard 256-bit encryption along with a strict no-logging-of-user-activity policy, kill switch, and P2P-supported servers. Upon cross-referencing Kaspersky VPN Secure Connection with other competitors, the affordability and strong fundamentals of the service make it an excellent introductory VPN for beginners to digital privacy, as well as for seasoned tech geeks.Learn MoreAll of the VPNs on our list have high ratings for security, but there are a few specific things you should look for if your safety threshold is a bit higher than that of an average user. We suggest paying attention to:No-log policies: This is the VPN promising that they don’t log locations or activities for any user. Certain VPNs offer third-party verified audits, while others provide detailed information on their code so users can see for themselves.Location: A variety of countries have specific regulations requiring data retention so they can investigate illegal activities, etc. Certain VPNs claim they avoid these restrictions by having their headquarters in places like the Bahamas or Panama. This is a somewhat murky subject, but worth watching for.Kill switches: When a VPN service suddenly drops or has an outage, a kill switch will automatically keep you from connecting to the internet, ensuring that your location or data are not accidentally exposed.Double encryption: Some of the best VPN services offer a double encryption mode that will encrypt data twice instead of just once. It may not be necessary, but if you are truly worried about hacking attempts it could be useful.A choice of security protocols: For those who really want to dig into privacy options, the ability to switch between security protocols like OpenVPN and IKEv2 can be useful.Due to the fact that it ticks all of these boxes, and thanks to additional advanced features like split tunneling, NordVPN takes the cake as the most secure VPN you can subscribe to right now.In the most basic terms, a virtual private network allows you to safely send information when using public networks via a group of networked computers and faraway servers. And while VPNs are effective at what they do, you should be aware of their limitations.For general data encryption and protection when online, they are an excellent choice. They can help prevent data throttling by hiding you from your ISP (internet service provider). They can get around regional restrictions or price changes by allowing users to switch servers at will. Additional features can restrict web access, help detect malicious sites, and other services.On the other hand, even the best VPN is not a security panacea. They can be detected and banned by governments, for example, and low-quality versions can log and even sell your data. Services can also block access to content when a VPN is used, which is why trying to get around something like Netflix’s regional restrictions can be hit or miss.All that said, so long as you understand their limitations and adjust your expectations accordingly, we definitely think that you should use a VPN in 2022 if you’re concerned with online privacy and security.Signing up for free VPNs, while tempting at first glance, can be a risky business. Know that all “free” services are making money off of you somehow (the old axiom that states “if something’s free, you’re the product” comes to mind), whether it be from advertisements or something less innocuous, such as selling user activity data. The best VPNs typically promise no activity or user logs and many boast third-party audits of this claim but do have fees.We’ve narrowed down the very best VPN service options above, but thanks to frequent deals and discounts, you’ll find that even the best services don’t cost that much. The small savings you get by using a free VPN really aren’t worth the trade-off in performance and protection. Check out our guide to are free VPNs are safe for more in-depth info about the risks and compromises involved with these.Virtual private networks themselves are perfectly legal in most jurisdictions, including the United States, and there’s nothing illegal about using one for anything you’d do on the internet that’s not an unlawful activity. At its most basic, a VPN is simply a network of privately operated servers that you connect to and through which your internet traffic is routed. That said, VPNs can still put the user in a legal gray area under certain circumstances. This largely comes down to geography.Certain countries and jurisdictions, particularly those where the state engages in censorship, have laws against circumventing these government restrictions, up to and including blanket bans on virtual private networks. China, Cuba, Iraq, Egypt, Turkey, and Russia are a few countries known for restricting or completely prohibiting VPN usage. If you’re concerned about this, make sure to read up on your national and local laws before you start shopping for a VPN.It also should go without saying that a VPN doesn’t cast a magic spell that makes illegal activities legal. Any action that is unlawful when conducted online without a VPN is still unlawful when using a VPN. This includes piracy. Peer-to-peer file-sharing protocols such as BitTorrent have many legitimate uses (open-source software distribution, for example), but illegally sharing copyrighted materials isn’t one of them. Bear this in mind if you’re specifically looking for a good VPN for torrenting.Also know that virtual private network providers are beholden to the laws of whichever country they’re registered in and may have to hand over information to law enforcement during the course of an investigation. Virtually all VPN operators boast a “no logs” policy, meaning that they do not keep a record of user activity. In this case, there would be nothing to hand over, although there’s no way to be fully certain that a VPN provider’s “no log” policy is being followed to the letter.Some VPNs have their no-log practices audited by independent third parties on a regular (typically annual) basis, but this still doesn’t offer 100% certainty. The only way to be sure that you stay out of trouble while using a VPN is to simply obey the law. A virtual private network is for protecting your privacy and keeping your sensitive personal information secure — not for conducting illegal activities outside of the purview of law enforcement.Finally, note that while not illegal, using a VPN does violate the terms of service of certain websites and apps (Netflix is one notable example). While breaking a company’s terms of service is not a crime, it can still result in that site or app restricting your access to its services and even shutting down your account. Virtual private networks often advertise that they are streaming- and gaming-friendly, but in our own tests we have frequently found this to be hit-and-miss. Be sure to do your research if you plan to use your VPN activities like these."

The failed festival has since featured in a hit documentary, known on Netflix as 'Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened'.A viral video showing one of the tent village accommodation sites at the Qatar World Cup has drawn criticisms online from furious fans likening it to failed music event, Fyre FestivalThe footage, taken on Snapchat, showed threadbare facilities with two beds inside a tentHost nation Qatar has already come under intense scrutiny for its stance on human rightsWith hotel booking incredibly limited in the tiny state, many fans have opted for the cheapest form of accommodation in the tent villages.While some reports of tent villages have spoken of luxury mod-cons - lots of space, air conditioning, ensuite bathroom, coffee and tea-making facilities, a TV, a hair dryer, iron and an ironing board, fridge, a safe and even wifi - the viral footage looks much more modest than some may be anticipating as they jet out to Qatar this week.FIFA described the accommodation with the luxury mod-cons as a 'unique experience' that will allow fans to connect with the culture of Qatar.'Fan Village Al Khor offers a unique experience of Arabian camping that both reflects and encompasses the traditions of Qatar,' the governing body's statement read.'The accommodation is comfortably furnished, laden with contemporary touches and in a style reminiscent of a traditional Qatari tent.'And yet the accommodation disappointment evident among influencers and fans at Fyre Festival was what immediately came to mind for many on social media after seeing the tent village clip.One fan wrote: 'Fyre Festival vibes.A second posted: 'The World Cup in Qatar is FIFA's equivalent of the Fyre Festival.A third simply put: 'This is going to be like Fyre Fest, isn't it?A fourth added: 'I think we'll get a Fyre Festival type documentary in the future when it comes to the Qatar World Cup.'One fan simply added: 'Qatar 2022 is going to be the Fyre Festival of futbol.Another said: 'If you're going to the Qatar World Cup the least you deserve is the Fyre Festival experience.Another posted: 'Brought to you by the fine people who created Fyre Festival.'Qatar has set up 30,000 rooms - with space for up to 60,000 guests - at 'fan villages' for the World Cup.The tournament gets underway on Sunday when Qatar take on Ecuador in the opening match.Gareth Southgate's England play their opening match, against Iran, a day later.Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usualWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

4853,float quadruples revenue,"Float quadruples revenue YoY despite increased competition, choppy economy","When Float launched its corporate card and spend management platform last year, first investor Michael Hyatt called it a company “in the centre of a red hot FinTech market.”Since then, that market has changed: Float, as well as its customers, are feeling the crunch of the economy, and more players have entered the Canadian market to address the spending needs of businesses.“In terms of new entrants, we’re clearly the fastest-growing and the largest.”Despite these challenges and amid choppy waters, Float claims to have seen its revenue and payments volume quadruple since its $37 million CAD, Tiger Global-led Series A round in November of last year. The startup has also entered two new product categories in recent months with a charge card and a USD card.As the once-sparse Canadian business spending market attracts new players, Float CEO Rob Khazzam sees those product additions and the fact that the startup continues to grow and attract new customers as its key to success.“In terms of new entrants, we’re clearly the fastest-growing and the largest,” Khazzam said in an interview with BetaKit.Its growth has indeed been rapid: in April, Float boasted more than 1,000 customers, and since then, claims to have doubled that number. When it comes to its new charge card and a USD card, Float boasts an eight-times and ten-times increase in usage, respectively, since both were soft-launched four months ago.The startup has also continued to hire and grow its team despite macroeconomic conditions leading a number of tech companies to make staff cuts. While Khazzam noted that Float has slowed its hiring, the company now sits at 60 people compared to around 40 in April, and just 15 at the beginning of this year.One of those hires is Andrew Dale, who is leading Float’s charge card product. Dale came to Float from Shopify where he was the finance lead on Shopify Balance and Capital, its banking and loan offerings.“It is definitely one of the most impressive growth curves that I’ve seen. Then you use the product and see why,” said Wave co-founder Kirk Simpson, an investor as well as customer of Float through his newly-launched startup Qui Identity.Khazzam said that Float has been able to continue its growth trajectory despite, and partly due to, the changing economy leading companies to tighten their spending.“Regardless of the volume of spending, product need is really never been more top of mind for customers,” he said. “In fact, you could argue [that for] a lot of customers there’s a lot of value in the control and visibility that Float provides in this economy.”The CEO claims Float has not seen any customer churn this year, continues to attract new customers monthly, and sees existing customers onboard more employees to its platform. He called September Float’s best month to date.A young startup itself, Float has not been immune to the effects of the economy and Khazzam noted that it is being cautious about its own spending.But Float has a decently-sized chest of cash to pull from.Float’s $37 million Series A round came less than six months after it raised its seed financing. Shortly after that Float secured $10 million in debt from Silicon Valley Bank as part of that round.In the months following, Float quietly raised additional capital from some of its existing investors.Khazzam declined to disclose the size of the financing, but noted that the raise was spurred on by the changing economic conditions and investors wanting to put in more money to ensure Float continues to grow.One of the investors that took part was Hyatt, who told BetaKit that Float didn’t require the capital, but called it a smart decision and an easy investment to make given the company’s growth numbers.Khazzam added that the financing was not Float’s Series B round, and the company “has ample capital and over three years of runway.”That runway is going to be useful as more companies enter the business spending space. In terms of Canadian players, Loop (formerly Lending Loop) refocused its business over the past year to include a cross-border payments card, with plans to provide more such services. Float launching a USD card brings those two closer in competition.Fortunately for Float, two other well-capitalized players in the space aren’t currently focused on the Canadian market. New York-based Ramp’s service remains limited to United States (US) firms, while San Francisco-based Brex only serves Canadian company customers with US operations and incorporation.Nonetheless, Canada has certainly been on Brex and Ramp’s radars, as the former opened up its first international office in Vancouver in 2020, and the latter acquired Vancouver-based Buyer in September 2021.Khazzam remains adamant that Float is not concerned with such competition and feels the company’s success comes from quickly innovating on products that its customers desire. He added that even with growing interest in the business spending space, Float’s biggest competition is banks.“It’s easy to become sort of complacent in a market … if you’re a big bank. You’ve got a lot of different products and services, it’s a very large business, [and] there are legacy practices at play,” he said. “We try to avoid all of that by building a company that is really, really, really customer obsessed. We are just endlessly focused on what we can do better to serve our customers.”However, unlike its consumer-focused counterparts, such as Wealthsimple, Koho, or Neo Financial, Khazzam feels less concerned about drawing customer attention away from the Big Banks over time.“Most businesses, if they have something, are either using a personal card under really subpar circumstances … or they have a corporate card from one of the banks that they personally guaranteed and has really low spending,” he told BetaKit last year.Now, Khazzam indicated that Float’s growth numbers point to the startup being able to successfully attract customers and fill a much-needed gap.Disclosure: Float has been a recent and ongoing advertiser on BetaKit.Meagan is the Senior Editor for BetaKit.

4688,2022 fifa world,Canada Soccer Odds For 2022 FIFA World Cup,"Later this year, Canada’s Men’s National Team will make its first trip to the FIFA World Cup since 1986. The Canucks will end a 36-year World Cup drought when they step onto the pitch in Qatar on Nov. 23 against Belgium. Canada sports betting apps have posted 2022 World Cup odds including lines for Canada’s first match, the prices for Canada to advance beyond the group stage, and the odds for Canada to win the 2022 World Cup.Canada appearing on the world’s biggest stage is not the only good news for soccer fans this year. On Thursday, June 16, FIFA announced the cities that will host games during the 2026 World Cup that will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Those cities include Toronto and Vancouver.One can’t be blamed for being unfamiliar with what Canada brings to the pitch. After all, there is a large segment of the world’s soccer-loving population that has never seen the Canadians play a meaningful international match.National team coach John Herdman, 46, has experienced international success on the women’s side, leading New Zealand to a pair of World Cup appearances and Canada to hardware in back-to-back Olympic Games. He was named head coach and head national director of Canada’s men’s set-up in 2018, an appointment that gave him responsibility for the senior team and everything down to the U-14 program.“I think the edge for me is I’m from the backstreets of Consett, County Durham,” Herdman told ESPN in a 2022 interview. “I’ve never had anything handed to me easy. I’ve never lived that professional life. I’ve had to fight for everything, every opportunity, and you had to fight to keep it.“That fight is something I tried to manifest in the environments you work in. It starts with that. There’s a human will to go on and get somewhere better, and that’s right at the core of what the players have understood about working with us.”Some may think of words like “spirit” and “fight” as euphemisms to describe teams that are undermanned, overmatched, and punching above their weight. The odds will support that sentiment, but fans still shouldn’t presume a swift, toothless exit.Canada boasts a number of capable players, including several starring in top European leagues. Jonathan David (Lille) and Cyle Larin (Besiktas) are dangerous goal-scoring threats; Tajon Buchanan (Club Brugge) can be dynamic on the wing; and Alphonos Davies (Bayern Munich) is a pacy fullback capable of adding to the attack. He’s also a serial winner, collecting a career’s worth of trophies at the German juggernaut by the age of 21.It’s no stretch to suggest that this is the best group that Canadians have ever seen — for what it’s worth, they did top the CONCACAF World Cup qualifying table. And while CONCACAF may not garner the same global reverence as some other governing bodies, namely UEFA, Canada took eight points off of Mexico and the US Men’s National Team — both ranked top 15 in FIFA — across four matches.The odds are undeniably stacked against Canada, but they shouldn’t be overlooked, even by the likes of Belgium.The World Cup has seen some heartwarming underdog stories over the years, but it would take quite the miracle for Canada to add another chapter to that catalog. In spite of its talent and grit, the Canadian national team lacks the World Cup and high-stakes international experience that some of the tournament’s more respected teams possess.To add some context, Canada is considered the “younger brother” to its southern neighbors. However, despite the relative pedestals the U.S. Men’s National Team and Mexico are placed upon in the region, they’re only +8000 and +10000, respectively, to win the World Cup. If CONCACAF’s “giants” are such longshots, it has to be difficult for one to expect Canada to pull off a stunner of galactic proportions this fall.It’s almost a requirement to suggest a team is stuck in the “Group of Death”. It’s a cliche that can realistically be applied to any group, including Group F.Canada’s opponents included the aforementioned Belgium (FIFA ranking: No. 2), Croatia (16), and Morocco (24). Conventional thinking suggests Canada needs a minimum of four points to put itself in the mix to advance. At first blush, that means a win — perhaps against Morocco — a draw versus Croatia, and a respectable performance against Belgium. Even with four points, Canada may have to hold its collective breath as tie-breaking scenarios unfold. A pair of upset wins over Croatia and Morocco, or Belgium for that matter — though that’s the most unlikely scenario — would make Canada a near-lock to advance to the knockout round.What a way to enter the World Cup for the first time in 36 years — open group play against the world’s No. 2 ranked side. Belgium is loaded with premium talent, including but certainly not limited to all-world midfielder Kevin De Bruyne and 6-3, 227-pound frontman Romelu Lukaku. The “Red Devils” have finished third in the World Cup (2018) and second in the Euros (1980), so this current generation — and the Royal Belgian Football Association in general — won’t be phased by the bright lights.Craig Williams is a Charlotte-based sportswriter who has worked professionally in the gaming, fantasy, and sports business industries.

More infoWhen 10-month-old Annabelle started coughing and wheezing, Kent mother Kate Skelton thought she had another bad cold - but as her breathing became more laboured and doctors refused to admit her to hospital, she became increasingly worried. With the UK seeing an increase in hospitalisations due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in under-5s, Mrs Skelton’s message to other parents is to be aware of the symptoms and trust their instincts.The first sign something was wrong was how hard it was for Annabelle to breathe, Mrs Skelton said. Her chest was contracting, she was breathing fast, and getting more and more lethargic. She said: “My gut was just screaming - this is not right.”Speaking about when she was sent home from the hospital, she told Express.co.uk: “My husband and I were so alarmed by the speed of her breathing that we sat up with her all night, counting her heart rate.”But it was not until their third trip to A&E that Annabelle was admitted. By that point she was rapidly deteriorating. Mrs Skelton said: “It was literally in a second. In the blink of an eye, it was so fast.”Annabelle was put on a ventilator and transferred in an ambulance to intensive care at King's College Hospital in London.Annabelle spent a week on a ventilator in hospital. (Image: Kate Skelton)Mrs Skelton said: “Watching her fight for her life, her tiny body covered in wires and being unable to hold her or touch her was terrifying.“There were so, so many wires - in her mouth, her nose, her hands, her legs, her fingers, her toes. She also had a canular and a catheter.”The doctors said Annabelle had bronchiolitis, a chest infection most commonly caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that causes a cough with a lot of mucus, making it a struggle to breathe. Mrs Skelton said: “I’d never heard of the condition, even though it is something eight out of 10 children will have had by their second birthday.”When Annabelle was taken off the ventilator after a week, she had no voice. “She was crying, but it was a silent cry … She was really, really sobbing, but with no noise and it was just really gut wrenching.“It just was so awful. And I felt like she had sort of gone into hospital this happy baby and just come out completely different.”Annabelle is now 7, and has been in hospital almost every winter. Mrs Skelton said she worries every year as cold and flu season approaches.She offered advice to other parents who might be worried about an ill child, saying: “Look for if your child is working really hard to breathe, if their chest is sucking in, if their chest is contracting, if their breathing is laboured, if there’s fast breathing.“It's all about knowing those signs, because if you don't know what you're looking out for, you can't spot it.”Parents are experts in their children and know what’s normal for them, she said, encouraging parents to “keep pushing” if they think something is wrong.She said: “I wish I'd known how serious bronchiolitis and RSV can be and how it can just look like a simple cold … how vital it is to be vigilant, how vital it is to follow your gut, and how vital it is to really push and advocate.”“I just thought she had a cold, I had no idea she was going to end up fighting for her life in intensive care.”"

3456,animals day week,"Soon, adopt wild animals for one day or a week","The fee for adoption of wild animals ranges from ₹1,000 to ₹3 lakh per annum.
| Photo Credit: M.A. SRIRAMAre you a wildlife enthusiast and animal lover and wish to adopt a wild animal for a day or a week? Here’s an opportunity as the century-old Mysuru zoo is revising its popular animal adoption scheme, introducing ‘flexible adoption plans’ to suit budget, choice of animals for adoption and occasions such as birthdays, wedding anniversaries.Presently, there is a provision to adopt an animal or a bird for a duration of one year, paying the stipulated adoption fees. In case of large carnivores like tigers, and animals like elephants, rhinos, the adoption fee runs into lakhs of rupees. Budget limit may come in the way of adopting a tiger for many who adore the animal.Understanding the people’s wish and their choice of adoption suiting their budgets, the zoo management has come forward to introduce the flexible adoption options, helping everyone to fulfil their wish of feeding animals or looking after their wellbeing.“We are in the midst of altering the adoption scheme, introducing options of adoption for one day, one week and one month. This is only to benefit animal lovers who shouldn’t be deprived of adopting their choice of animals for budget reasons. Moreover, the larger idea is to engage more people into conservation and the measure may help in achieving the goal,” said Zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni.He told The Hindu that the engineers have sought a month’s time to alter software of adoption scheme, suiting flexi plans. “Once it is done, we can announce the launch since the day-wise adoption fee has already been prepared. Maybe, the flexi scheme will come into effect from next year,” Mr. Kulkarni said.If the visitor feedback is one reason, the flexible adoption plans introduced at Bannerghatta Biological Park that evoked overwhelming response is another reason for altering the scheme. “I think many will take up the cause if the scheme suited every person. We too thought of replicating it at Mysuru zoo though we are the first to launch the scheme two decades ago,” the director said.Film personalities, cricketers, celebrities, politicians, industries and PSUs and others were adopting animals and birds over the years, showing their love and commitment towards conservation.The adoption fees were hiked this year across the State zoos, categorising the types of adoption. The species have been categorised in diamond class, gold class, silver class, and bronze class. The adoption fee ranges from ₹1,000 to ₹3,00,000 per annum.In the diamond class, elephants, gorilla, lion, tiger, giraffe, orangutan, chimpanzee, Indian rhinoceros, hippopotamus, zebra, and African hunting cheetah have been included and the adoption fee ranges from ₹75,000 to ₹3,00,000 for a period of one year.In the gold class, black panther, Indian leopard, sloth bear, Asiatic black bear, gaur, jaguar, cape buffalo are included and their adoption costs ₹50,000 per annum. In the same class, the adoption of Indian fox, golden jackal, Indian grey wolf, striped hyena, dhole, lion-tailed macaque, common langur, Nilgiri langur and hamadryas baboon costs ₹30,000 per annum.In the silver class, the adoption fee ranges from ₹10,000 to ₹15,000 and the animal and birds included under this class are swamp deer, scarlet macaw, slender Loris, hog deer, black swan, Sarus crane, saltwater crocodile, Nile crocodile, leopard cat, great Indian hornbill and others. The adoption fee ranges from ₹1,000 to ₹5,000 in bronze class which mostly comprises different species of birds.Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

884,headhunter 25 years,I’ve been a headhunter for 25 years and I’ve never seen a job market like this,"""Right now, companies are experiencing a similar situation: all of their job postings are just not attracting applicants as they used to""By Tara De Boer
November 15, 2022Bruce Macdonald of Macdonald Search Group (Photo courtesy Macdonald)Thanks to an influx of retiring baby boomers—300,000 this year!—and employees changing demands coming out of the pandemic, with benefits like flex-hours and options to work-from-home as top priorities, the Canadian job market is facing a hiring bust. Job openings are abundant, but employers are scraping the barrel to try and find quality candidates to fill them.Bruce MacDonald has been head hunting for over two decades and is the managing partner of MacDonald Search Group, the cross-Canada head hunting firm which he founded in 2010. We spoke with him to hear about what’s caused the outsize challenge, what employees today are demanding, and how he thinks the labour market will look in the coming years.Q: How would you compare the market today, compared to 25 years ago when you first started in the head-hunting business?A: I have never seen a market like it is today, post-COVID-19. If we were to go back 25 years ago, the baby boomers would be aged between 35 and 55. That was a really large demographic group, so there was a higher number of candidates out there and available. Now, the youngest portion of the baby boomer group would be 60 years old, and most of them are heading into retirement. So the market is extremely tight for quality candidates at this point.In the U.S they coined the term “Great Resignation” but I wouldn’t put it that way. I would call it the “Great Empowerment.” In March 2020, everybody took home their laptops and their monitors and they all started to work from home. As we moved into 2021, many companies had record years in terms of profitability, and candidatesrealized, “Hey, wait a minute. I’m working from home, I can walk the dog at one o’clock, and yet my company just had a record year?” The pandemic empowered candidates to look at opportunities on their terms. That’s been the big difference. They want a flexible working situation, they want to work from home.Q: What kinds of demands are you hearing as part of this “Great Empowerment” you’re seeing?Asking for flexibility of work location and salary, for sure. I think there’s more pressure from the candidate pool on salary now due to inflation. Another thing is that in the last three-four months, I’ve seen a number of candidates that have actually signed an offer, and then just decided not to show up on the start date. And the reason is that they found another opportunity, or they’ve been counter-offered. You know, the number of counter-offers that are out there have probably doubled since pre-COVID19. That’s because those companies who are potentially losing that particular employee know how hard it is. They don’t want to lose somebody, so they pony up and they add more money to their current compensation. When counter-offers do occur, sooner or later things do fall apart. But in the heat of the moment, people will take the quick money, right?Q: What other ways can employers attract talent?So it’s interesting. If you go back 15 to 25 years ago, the onus was on the candidate to secure the job. All of the interviewing and the screening processes were all about the candidate, proving to the company that they were the right choice. Companies in today’s environment that are more successful do a little bit of selling themselves. They put some effort into selling their company to the candidate versus the other way around.I have seen companies with a job vacancy for six months, and after looking on their own for three or four months, they come to us, and we get them to the offer stage. And they actually have to walk away and restart the process all over again and will end up with a vacancy, maybe for nine or twelve months. Because they don’t have the ability or resources to bridge the gap of employee demands, whether it be a salary demand, or a work location demand.Q: After two years of many people having to work from home during the pandemic, is the option to work from home a demand you are seeing more often than not?Most of the time—more than half the time—people are asking the work-from-home question. And as commutes become more challenging, these questions are more often coming up for those in the major city centres—in the GTA, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary.I would say from a demographic perspective, people under 35 are most often asking about whether or not you can either work from home, or have some sort of flexibility. It has come up in practically every search that we’ve worked on over the course of the last year, and it is a major hot button in the marketplace for people. But many traditional and longtime companies that are multinational or global corporations have also pivoted and are offering an understanding that candidates may want to only work in the office three days a week, or four days a week, and I think it provides an acknowledgment of what the candidates are looking for.But there are other companies that are asking their employees to come back. The telling tale in all of this will be whether or not companies still maintain efficiencies and growth. But it’s a mixed bag right now. It’s really up in the air, believe it or not, as to how work-from-home demands will affect our client companies.Q: Which industries are you seeing having to fight for employees and entertain counter-offers the most?I don’t think there’s any one particular industry, I really believe it’s affected the entire employment population out there. MacDonald Search Group works in all industries: consumer products, pharmaceuticals, we work in industrial products, we work with business-to-business products and services. We’ve got consultants that work in manufacturing operations and supply chain, and finance. And I don’t think there’s any particular industry, nor is there any particular job role that has not been affected by all of this. It’s almost prevalent everywhere we look.Q: Some employers are using social media, like TikTok and Instagram as a tactic to attract younger talent. What do you make of this?I would say that LinkedIn is the only effective place right now. It’s an interesting tool for the candidate pool, it’s almost like a Facebook for people to put their careers up on the open market.Right now, companies are all experiencing a similar situation in that all of their job postings are just not attracting applicants as they used to. For example, we have probably a couple of 100 jobs posted on our website, and we’re national, right across Canada with six offices. Frankly, we would probably fill less than 5 per cent of the roles that we work on through an application. It’s more about having to go out and find them. I think that’s what’s happening more often than not – we are receiving more calls from companies who in the last five to ten years, had never previously gone to an external recruitment avenue. Now they’re coming to us telling us that they just can’t find people. So it’s the market tightness. That is the biggest determinant of what’s going on out there more than anything.Q: As a headhunter, you’re in this unique position where you speak with both candidates and the employers. Are you seeing a disconnect between the wants and needs of the two sides?A little bit. I think that because the dynamics in the marketplace have changed, it’s going to take time for companies to absorb that change in the market, to pivot or alter their approach. Most recruiters in Canada might agree that on the company or the client side, they have been a little bit slow to react to what they may have to do in order to attract quality people to their organizations. That’s probably understandable too, they’re not going to do it overnight. But I would say that the biggest thing I’ve observed so far is at the client side, it has been a touch slow to react to what’s going on out there. Most of the companies that we deal with are larger organizations. So I don’t think they’re going to run the risk of going under if they don’t pivot, but I do think that there will be some ramifications to how they do their business for sure. For example, if it’s a sales company or manufacturing group of employers, they could become less efficient and they could lose sales. There’s a whole lot of different things that could occur. If they can’t secure the right people to fulfill the roles that they need, then they’re going to become less proficient at what they do. It’s our job to try and help them understand. We do that in every one of our searches at the very onset, and say ‘Look, things have changed.” I’m a baby boomer, and myself, I haven’t experienced any sort of worldwide, life-changing events like COVID-19 was.Q: What direction do you see things heading in the next couple of years in the Canadian job market?The market tightness is going to stay for a period of time, just based on demographics, until perhaps Canada opens up more immigration. But I don’t know if I can foresee any significant changes. The candidates hold the power right now. It’s a newer generation, an energetic and vibrant generation and they’re not afraid to issue their demands, whatever they are. When I grew up and worked in the corporate world, we were always taught to ask what you could do for the company. The newer generation is saying, “Hey, what can the company do for me?”Get the Best of Maclean's sent straight to your inbox.

Sean brought his Oscar statuette as a symbol of faith in our victory of our country.”“There are three places in the world that all the pride of my life will be,” Penn told Zelenskyy during their latest meeting. “The place where my daughter was born, the place where my son was born, and this.”Penn’s visit to Ukraine concluded with a trip to Kyiv’s “Alley of Courage,” an honorary site Zelenskyy established in August that recognizes “people who have stood with Ukraine from the very beginning” and now includes him, according to Reuters."
4222,ceo quits company,"TikTok CEO quits as company reportedly plans sale to Microsoft, Walmart","TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer, who only began the job on June 1, is heading right back out the door again as the company plans a sale under pressure from the White House.""In recent weeks, as the political environment has sharply changed, I have done significant reflection on what the corporate structural changes will require, and what it means for the global role I signed up for,"" Mayer wrote in an email to TikTok employees late Wednesday. ""Against this backdrop, and as we expect to reach a resolution very soon, it is with a heavy heart that I wanted to let you all know that I have decided to leave the company.""Mayer praised employees' efforts, saying that ""there is no doubt that the future [of TikTok] is incredibly bright."" But at the same time, he added, ""I understand that the role that I signed up for—including running TikTok globally—will look very different as a result of the US Administration’s action to push for a sell off of the US business.""Until this spring, Mayer was one of Disney's top executives, where he successfully headed the launch of the Disney+ streaming service. In February, however, he was unexpectedly passed over to succeed outgoing Disney CEO Bob Iger in favor of Bob Chapek. Three months later he announced he was jumping ship to TikTok, in a move that spawned dozens of stories about TikTok's meteoric growth and its potential to make it big as a force in media.AdvertisementTikTok, in its official statement on Mayer's departure, said, ""We appreciate that the political dynamics of the last few months have significantly changed what the scope of Kevin’s role would be going forward, and fully respect his decision.""Even as TikTok's popularity has skyrocketed amid the 2020 pandemic, though, the company itself has been struggling against the Trump administration. Earlier this month, the White House declared the existence of TikTok—along with another Chinese app, WeChat—to be a national emergency and issued an executive order that would effectively ban it from operating inside the United States.TikTok has repeatedly denied the administration's allegations that it shares US user data with China, and it filed suit on Monday alleging that the orders are unconstitutional and politically driven by an ""anti-China political campaign"" ahead of the November election.President Donald Trump on August 3 issued a personal ultimatum, telling TikTok it had until September 15 to sell to a US buyer if it wanted to keep operating inside the United States. Microsoft at the time publicly confirmed it was considering a way to purchase TikTok's US assets and has been considered the leading contender for an acquisition since.Today, however, Walmart unexpectedly announced that it has joined forces with Microsoft to go in together on the deal.Walmart wants TikTok for its potential to integrate e-commerce and advertising, the company said. ""We believe a potential relationship with Tik Tok US in partnership with Microsoft could add this key functionality and provide Walmart with an important way for us to reach and serve omnichannel customers as well as grow our third-party marketplace and advertising businesses.""Walmart added, ""We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of US Tik Tok users while satisfying the concerns of US government regulators.""Sources told CNBC that TikTok is expected to announce a sale ""as soon as next week,"" ahead of Trump's September 15 deadline and that the transaction is expected to be valued at between $20 billion and $30 billion."
623,explored new exhibition,Little black dress phenomenon explored in new exhibition,"Chanel’s 1926 design was considered radically modern at the time and was hailed by US Vogue as “the frock that all the world will wear”.Areas of the exhibition will be dedicated to highlighting black British designers whose work explores both blackness in terms of identity and the role the colour plays in crafting a futuristic, sci-fi aesthetic.Georgina Ripley, principal curator of modern and contemporary design at National Museums Scotland, said: “Few garments are as iconic as the little black dress, which has often been held up by the fashion industry as the one piece every woman should have in her wardrobe. It has evolved dramatically in the century since its creation.“From a simple shift dress which helped democratise women’s fashion to a bold political statement, it has moved through various iterations which reflect changing ideals of beauty and body image.“Displaying classic couture, avant-garde pieces and garments that make a political statement, this exhibition will explore its enduring success, and ask why, in the fickle and fast-paced fashion world, the little black dress has achieved that rare status of being truly above the fray.”The exhibition also considers how perceptions of the colour black differ in a global context, as well as how the intervention of smart technologies are establishing a blueprint for a more sustainable future.It will run from Saturday July 1 to Sunday October 29, sponsored by Baillie Gifford Investment Managers.Sam Pattman, philanthropy manager at Baillie Gifford, said: “We are delighted that our successful relationship with National Museums Scotland continues with our support for Beyond The Little Black Dress.“This exciting exhibition takes a fresh look at a timeless classic, examining how it has remained in style for nearly a century and displaying a dazzling selection of garments from those worn by royalty to truly avant-garde creations at the cutting edge of the fashion industry.”Sign up for exclusive newsletters, comment on stories, enter competitions and attend events."
1409,millionaire private jet,Lula faces backlash after flying to Cop27 on millionaire’s private jet,"Brazil’s president-elect has faced a backlash at home after flying to the Cop27 environmental summit on a private jet owned by a millionaire businessman.Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was elected on 30 October and has vowed to undo much of the environmental damage wrought by the outgoing far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.Under Bolsonaro, Amazonian deforestation hit a 15-year high after he gutted protection agencies and encouraged loggers, prospectors and ranchers into the rainforest to take advantage of its abundant natural resources.But Lula’s decision to fly to Egypt on a Gulfstream G600 owned by a health industry mogul was criticised by both opponents and supporters.“If he is really travelling on [a] private jet it’s a careless mistake he should have avoided,” one former minister said. “There are things you can’t do as a president, even before being sworn in.”Lula’s spokesman said he would not comment on the issue but his vice-president-elect said the plane’s owner, José Seripieri Junior, was accompanying Lula to Egypt rather than lending him the aircraft.Lula’s transition coordinator argued he had committed no crime.“Lula is not yet president of the republic, he doesn’t have the use of government aircraft,” Wellington Dias said on the Roda Viva interview show. “So there’s no rule that stops him from getting a lift.”Dias pointed out that Lula cannot travel on commercial airlines due to the significant chance of him being harassed or attacked by far-right radicals, some of whom have openly expressed a wish to see him dead.But the controversy, coming just two weeks after Lula beat Bolsonaro in the tightest runoff election since Brazil’s military dictators gave up power in 1985, was evidence he will enjoy little or no honeymoon period.Lula does not take power until 1 January but last week the Brazilian real lost value against the dollar and the stock market had its biggest one-day fall in almost a year after he gave a speech saying he would govern for the poor, not the financial markets.Both recouped much of the value the next day but it was a stark warning that the leftist leader will have little room for manoeuvre, especially with Bolsonaro forces strong in Congress and hardcore supporters still on the streets denying the election result.Lula served as president between 2003 and 2011 before giving way to Workers’ party colleague Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff was impeached and a corruption scandal engulfed the party, leading to Lula’s imprisonment in 2018.He was released almost two years later and the charges were annulled on a technicality but many voters have never forgiven him.The furore over his trip to Egypt added to the sense of foreboding after the private jet’s owner was named as Seripieri Junior, founder of Qualicorp, one of Brazil’s best-known private health plans.Seripiero founded Qualicorp in 1997 but left the company in 2019 and now runs another health plan called Qsaúde. He was briefly arrested in 2020 as part of an investigation into illegal campaign funding.He was also an early backer of Lula’s presidential bid, hosting dinners with other business leaders who had shown reluctance to meet with the leftist challenger."

1925,munich returning ambassador,Franck Ribery has 'already held talks with Bayern Munich about returning as an ambassador',"Despite leaving in 2019, Ribery is still a much-loved figure at Bayern, and the move to snap him up as an official ambassador for the club is thought to be well-supported within the club.Ribery won the treble with Bayern in 2013If he does end up back at the Allianz Arena in an ambassadorial capacity, he will join fellow former players Giovane Elber and Claudio Pizarro, now 50 and 44 years old respectively.But not only is it a matter of desire for the Frenchman to return to the club he called home for more than a decade, as he still owns a villa in Grünwald from his time in Bavaria.During his 12-year stay at the Bundesliga side, making more than 400 appearances, the 39-year-old was part of the 2013 treble-winning team, his only Champions League success at the club.He also won the award for UEFA's Best Player in Europe in the same year as a mark of his contributions to the team's success, scoring 11 and assisting 23 in the process.His time in Germany came to an end in 2019, when he joined Fiorentina, before arriving at US Salernitana in September 2021, where he would eventually retire 13 months later.Despite being one of the world's leading wide forwards, as well as a mainstay in one of the most dominant Bayern sides in recent years, the Frenchman was forced to draw his career to a close a a result of knee injuries at the Italian side.Ribery retired from professional football in October 2022 as a result of continuing knee issuesHowever he has not concluded his association with I Granata, and is currently operating as an assistant coach for the side that finds itself in 12th place in Serie A at the point of the World Cup break.On the announcement of his retirement in October 2022, Bayern CEO Oliver Kahn stated: 'One of the greatest careers in football – not just FC Bayern – is coming to an end with Franck Ribery.'I had the fortune to play together with him and could see clearly from my goal how he excited our fans with his attacking play at the other end of the pitch. Franck was a rogue on the pitch, something very special, stood for cunning.'FC Bayern is proud to have had him in its ranks for over 10 years and to have won the biggest titles with him.'The Frenchman has taken up an assistant manager role at the Serie A side since retiringDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usualWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

5119,witney lost railway,'Death of a branch line' video explains how Witney lost its railway,"A rail enthusiast has sent an evocative video detailing how Witney lost its railway.'Death of a branch line' follows the demise of the Oxford, Witney and Fairford railway which served passengers until 1962 when the Witney to Fairford line closed, with goods only services between Witney and Yarnton ceasing in 1970.Witney Oxford Transport Group (“WOT Group”), a group of West Oxfordshire volunteers, is seeking to rebuild the railway linking Oxford, Eynsham, Witney and Carterton.The campaign recently received a boost when Grosvenor, the lead developer of the Salt Cross Garden Village project on the A40 near Eynsham, came out in support.Chair of WOT Charlie Maynard has also said the current £161million upgrade to Oxford Station that will allow additional services by 2024, improves the chances of a Eynsham, Witney and Carterton link.Witney, Carterton and Eynsham collectively represent one of the largest populations not just in the county, but also in the country, without a rail link, says WOT.Bill Wall wrote: ""I read with interest your article on the proposal to revamp a railway to Witney and beyond.""I have a long link to the original railway that ran to Fairford from Oxford. My grandfather, father, uncle and brother were all driving and working for Great Western Railway.""My father is also mentioned in a book written on the branch lines of the Great Western.""I was born in Cirencester and lived in Fairford then Eynsham. I remember seeing the steam trains running along the back of the Eynsham playing field.""It would be great to see trains running again - even the odd steamer one day!""I am retired in Western Australia now but often visit when we can.

2794,new audience,How Muna got a fresh start and a new audience - with a bit of help from Phoebe Bridgers,"Six years later, they're back for a sold-out UK tour, playing major venues like London's Roundhouse and Manchester's Albert Hall. But their journey has been far from easy.Muna formed in 2013 at the University of Southern California. after McPherson spotted Gavin cycling through the campus and told a friend: ""That girl's cool.""Later, they hooked up with fellow guitarist Josette Maskin at a party and wrote their first song while everyone else got drunk.Gavin immediately proved to be a sharp lyricist, telling compassionate and precise stories of heartbreak, intimacy, and the complications of growing up queer (all three members identify as queer and McPherson is non-binary).The synth-pop anthem I Know A Place talked about finding a sense of belonging in gay clubs, while Loudspeaker was a defiant riposte to bigots everywhere: ""Every time I don't shut up, it's a revolution"".Critics loved them. NPR said their music was ""what relatability feels like to people who've always felt different"". Harry Styles invited them on tour. Taylor Swift included them on playlists.But despite the acclaim, they remained a cult band signed to a major label, and when the pandemic hit, they were dropped as part of a cost-cutting drive.For a moment, they were left adrift. Gavin admits they considered packing it all in. But then they found a white knight, or maybe it was a guardian angel... Either way, it was indie star Phoebe Bridgers, who'd been a fan for years.""Phoebe's manager had made it very clear that if we were ever single, she'd be interested in working with us,"" says Gavin.""So we had a conversation pretty shortly after we were dropped and she was like, 'I love everything you're doing and I would like to support you so you can keep doing it'.""Once Bridgers signed Muna to her Saddest Factory Records label in 2021, their fortunes changed overnight.Their self-titled third album became their first record to chart in the UK and US; and the lead single, a girl crush anthem called Silk Chiffon, was a certifiable smash hit - thanks partly to a guest verse from their new boss.""The whole situation is an indicator of how we're subconsciously rebellious,"" says McPherson. ""When we were on a major label we didn't want to make a big pop song and now that we're on an indie, it's like, 'Well, go on then, why not have a bit of fun?!'""Silk Chiffon exposed Muna to a whole new audience, something they discovered belatedly, after setting out on tour this summer.""So we started asking people, 'Hey, who hasn't been to a show before? Raise your hand!' And sometimes it'd be 75% of a crowd. We talk about it all the time.""Figure caption,Warning: Third party content may contain advertsOlder fans will know that the breezy sound of Silk Chiffon, with its fluttering harmonies and flirtatious lyrics, is a big departure for the band.It illustrates a new way of thinking for Gavin, who has struggled with anxiety, body dysmorphia and other people's homophobia her entire adult life.""As people who experience an array of different marginalised identities, what is the point if you're not trying to find some happiness?"" she says.""If you're not seeking that out it's not going to present itself to you. So you kind of have to make an effort to be happy, even though that sounds a bit cringe.""And we feel very touched that other people who struggle resonated with the song and are still making memes about it. It's very sweet and important to us.""The positivity and hopefulness of Silk Chiffon continues throughout the band's new album.What I Want is a thunderous, post-pandemic ode to going absolutely berserk on a night out. Anything But Me describes the relief of escaping a bad relationship. Loose Garment is about treating yourself with kindness.""I used to wear my sadness like a choker / Yeah, it had me by the throat,"" sings Gavin over a subdued guitar lick. ""Tonight I feel I'm draped in it / Like a loose garment.""Like many Muna songs, it was prompted by the end of a relationship, but this time ""there was a difference in the way that I handled that pain,"" says Gavin.""Historically if I'm in pain, I actually want to make it more painful. But that night, I went on a walk by the LA River and I went to dinner and watched the sun go down and did something nice for myself at a time when I was really hurting - and I felt a swell of gratitude for this new ability to make things easier [for myself] instead of making them harder.""Image source, Frank OckenfelsImage caption,Muna (L-R): Naomi McPherson, Katie Gavin and Josette MaskinIt's an idea Gavin makes explicit on another track, the Shania Twain-influenced Kind Of Girl.With lyrical call-backs to Muna's previous albums, she describes herself as someone who ""presses a little too hard"" and is ""in love with the pain"". But instead of dwelling on those emotions, as she would have in the past, Gavin resolves to evolve.""I'm a girl who's learning everything I say isn't definitive,"" she sings. ""I like telling stories / But I don't have to write them in ink.""The 29-year-old says the song was inspired by studying her old lyrics.""I was concerned about writing the same song over and over,"" she says, ""and so I was confronted with my own patterns, in a way that someone who's not a songwriter maybe wouldn't be.""""I was like, 'Wow, I'm really doing the same stuff over and over again. So if I want to continue, I need to make some new choices because I deserve to feel better.""And part of the reason I wanted to feel better is because I wanted to show up for this group - so it's beautiful that it all ends up going back into the songs and we can share that with other people.""Figure caption,Warning: Third party content may contain advertsThat belief, in giving a voice to marginalised people like themselves, is what unites the band.""Part of the reason I was attracted to [the group] is because when Katie wrote Loudspeaker I was like, 'OK, someone's going to hear this song and it's going to matter',"" says Maskin.""It's hard, I think, to write a song with a meaning that is actually good - but Katie has a gift.""The sense of responsibility isn't lost on them, but Gavin carefully rejects the notion that Muna should be put on a pedestal.""When we play these days, there's an incredible amount of energy because people are using these songs to release stuff,"" she says. ""But we've just decided to channel that, let it go through without thinking, 'This is all happening because of me.' Because it's not.""Just being a part of it, I think, is really the privilege.""And that audience will grow even further next summer thanks to Taylor Swift, who has booked Muna to play on her 2023 stadium tour."

Equity Research Analyst Carlos Angelo O. Temporal said in a Viber message on Wednesday.“The local bourse declined amid profit taking after three straight days of the market rally, while waiting for the BSP meeting tomorrow. At the BSP meeting, aside from the anticipated interest rate hike, we think that investors will be waiting for the outlook of the central bank toward the inflation rate at least for the end of the year,” Philstocks Financial, Inc.

He has had things thrown at him, including stones and fireworks.""Just recently, a mother sent her child to the door to collect some items, but I needed to see ID.""The woman came out screaming and yelling abuse at me because she'd been disturbed, then she snatched the order, pushed me out and slammed the door on me,"" he says.Image source, Victoria Middleton The Retail TrustImage caption,Ian has had stones and fireworks thrown at him during his work as a delivery driver""I don't want to keep facing this, but recently it seems to have got worse. I've noticed that there is a lot more hostility now, which is actually very painful. I've realised the customer isn't always right,"" the 31-year-old says.Another supermarket worker, in Yorkshire, who preferred to remain anonymous, said he was attacked after approaching two women he believed were shoplifting.""They began to throw stock at me, punched one of my colleagues and on the way out one of the women lunged at me and dug her nails into my head.""That night I had to go home and explain to my two young girls why I had a massive cut on my head. It really does weigh on your mental health, and my family worries about my safety,"" he said.Part of the reason behind this rising tide of aggression towards retail workers may be the increased pressure on people from the cost of living, the Retail Trust suggests.A separate a YouGov poll of 2,000 UK adults commissioned by the trust found nearly half admitted to getting annoyed with a shop worker, delivery driver or somebody working in customer services in the last year. Of these, 19% - or nearly one in five - said they raised their voice or lost their temper.When asked for the cause of their frustration 62% of the total polled - more than six in ten - cited rising prices, while 63% blamed their behaviour on the lack staff in store generally and at checkouts. More than half also blamed items being out of stock.""We're hearing daily from retail workers who are being shouted at, spat on, threatened and hit at work. One shopworker was told by a customer that they hoped they got cancer and died,"" Chris Brook Carter, chief executive of the Retail Trust says.""This is having a devastating and long-lasting impact on real people's lives. Many are extremely anxious about going into work and having to take time off or even quitting.""One worker from an electrical goods store described it as ""like being a human punch bag, every single day"".The charity's Let's Respect Retail campaign aims to highlight the ""intolerance epidemic"" and send a message to shoppers to change their behaviour.It is also encouraging workers to report abuse, and use the Retail Trust's free helpline.The Usdaw union, which represents shop workers and delivery drivers welcomed the campaign. General Secretary Paddy Lillis served to highlight ""the significant issues faced by retail workers simply as a result of going to work. We are saying loud and clear that abuse is not a part of the job""."

738,trump announces 2024,Trump Announces 2024 Presidential Bid Days After Costing GOP the Midterms,"Former U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during a rally for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) on November 6, 2022 in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Joe Raedle / Getty Images)Former President Donald Trump announced he’s running for president on Tuesday night, launching his 2024 comeback bid just days after his slate of election-denying candidates cost Republicans in races around the country and badly damaged his grip on the Republican Party.“In order to make America great and glorious again I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump proclaimed to a crowd at his Mar-a-Lago home.AdvertisementTrump’s campaign announcement marks not so much a return to politics as it does a continuation of his assault on democracy to further his personal political ambitions. The former president spent his years in office undercutting democratic institutions before staging an attempted coup to remain in office. The House impeached him twice—the second time after he incited a riot where his supporters besieged the U.S. Capitol. His efforts to remain in office have triggered multiple legal investigations—not to mention an FBI raid on his Mar-a-Lago home aimed at recovering boxes of classified documents he allegedly illegally took with him when he left office.All that had done little to shake his firm grip on the GOP. But the shockingly poor results for the Republican Party in last week’s midterm elections—caused in large part by Trump-backed candidates losing winnable races up and down the ballot—have suddenly made Trump’s path to the 2024 GOP presidential nomination look much more uncertain.Trump spent the past two years maintaining his viselike grip over the Republican Party, making sure that the slate of GOP candidates running for office in this year’s midterms overwhelmingly supported his lies about the election and, by extension, would help him continue to undercut democratic institutions to help his 2024 chances. Most of the candidates he endorsed for office won their primaries this year.AdvertisementA majority of Republican nominees for Congress and statewide office in 2022 echoed Trump’s falsehoods about the 2020 election. But many of them lost last week, costing Republicans Senate control, a number of governorships in swing states, and leaving them with what appears likely to be the bare minimum of seats needed for House control.But now Trump is getting blamed for his party’s disappointing midterm losses in battleground states—and his return to the campaign spotlight has further frustrated Republicans who wanted him to stay on the sidelines at least until Georgia’s Senate runoff election is decided in early December.Trump painted himself into a corner—after toying with the idea of launching his campaign right before the midterms, he announced last Monday that he’d make his “big announcement” on Tuesday, publicly locking in the date right before his party’s election flub. Now his stubborn refusal to ever admit that he’s wrong has forced him into announcing his 2024 campaign at the moment where he’s appeared weakest politically in at least two years.During his rambling, 70-minute announcement speech, Trump couldn’t help but push falsehoods about past elections. He claimed that China meddled in the 2020 election to help defeat him and later promised an end to early and absentee voting. And he bizarrely said during his time in office the U.S. went “decades without a war” (he was there for four years), before delivering a smorgasbord of complaints about the Biden administration, pledged to execute any drug dealer arrested under his regime, and complained that he was unfairly targeted by the “deep state.”Advertisement“I'm a victim, I will tell you, I'm a victim,” he complained an hour into his speech.And he sought to push the blame on the GOP’s poor showing elsewhere—even as he insisted Republicans will do better next election.“Much criticism is being placed on the fact that the Republican Party should have done better and frankly much of the blame is correct but the citizens of our country have not yet realized the full extent and gravity of the pain that our nation is going through. … I have no doubt that by 2024 it will sadly be much worse and they will see much more clearly what happened and what is happening to our country and the voting will be much different in 2024.It wasn’t until more than 20 minutes into his speech that Trump announced his candidacy, in a speech that sounded much like a lower-energy version of the campaign speech he’s been delivering for months.The GOP’s Trump-fueled midterm losses, combined with Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ sweeping reelection victory, marked the first real split of Republicans from Trump since a brief moment in the immediate wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, with many Republicans publicly blaming Trump for their party’s setbacks and touting DeSantis as a viable alternative for 2024.Rupert Murdoch’s media empire has turned hard against Trump in recent days: his tabloid New York Post ran covers portraying Trump as “Trumpty Dumpty” and DeSantis as “DeFuture,” Fox News spent a lot more time in recent days touting DeSantis’ victory than defending Trump, and the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board has taken repeated shots at Trump in recent days, calling him “the Republican Party’s biggest loser” in one recent editorial.AdvertisementThe fiscally conservative Club for Growth, a one-time close Trump ally that broke with him over some primary endorsements over the past year, released post-midterms polling that showed DeSantis leading Trump by double-digit margins in head-to-head matchups in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire as well as in Georgia and Florida.And multiple Republican lawmakers who were big Trump boosters have refused to say whether they’ll back Trump in 2024.Even some of Trump’s old yes-men dunked on his announcement speech. Former Trump White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney pointed out that Trump’s boast about his win-loss record in the 2022 elections was wildly inflated:Trump has spent the week since the midterms raging falsely about stolen elections, attacking his GOP foes including DeSantis (he keeps trying to make the nickname “DeSanctimonious” stick) and Murdoch’s empire, rather than framing up a 2024 campaign message.As he’s raged, other Republicans who have been gearing up for their own 2024 campaigns have moved forward with their plans. Former Vice President Mike Pence is about to launch his book tour in what’s long expected to be a curtain-raiser for a White House bid of his own, and told ABC News on Tuesday that Trump endangered him and his family during the Capitol Riot. Trump’s former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is running ads in the early primary states. Outgoing Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has toured those states as well.AdvertisementThis doesn’t mean Trump is cooked. There have been many points where the GOP establishment refused to back Trump before coming back into the fold when it became clear that base Republican voters were still firmly behind him—the 2016 primaries, after his “grab her by the pussy” remarks became public, after the Capitol riot. He retains a huge number of rabid supporters, and especially in a crowded primary field could win, just like he did in 2016.And Trump still has his own looming legal troubles to contend with. The Justice Department continues to investigate the causes of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, has subpoenaed countless Trump 2020 hangers-on, and could still bring charges for the classified documents that Trump removed from the White House as he left office. He’s also facing an ongoing legal threat in Georgia, where Fulton County District Attorney Fani WIllis is investigating potential crimes related to his attempt to strong arm local officials into overturning his loss in that state.Trump toyed for months with the idea of launching his 2024 campaign before the midterms, but advisers and other Republicans kept talking him out of it, worried that his presence could hurt other Republican candidates. The Republican National Committee said they’d stop paying his legal bills if he became a candidate and warned that he wouldn’t be able to touch much of the vast sums of money he’s raised with his post-presidential organization once he became an active candidate.AdvertisementTrump may be down, but he’s shown before that he has enough die-hard supporters that he shouldn’t be counted out in a GOP primary. His name recognition is through the roof, he remains popular with base voters, and he’s a fundraising machine.And at least before the election he still looked like the prohibitive favorite: early polls showed him leading DeSantis and the rest of the potential field of candidates by a wide margin.If Trump wins the primary, he’ll likely have a rematch against President Joe Biden who has strongly signaled he’ll run for reelection, setting up a likely rematch of two unpopular aging politicians.Biden won the national popular vote by nearly 7 million votes in 2020, but he barely beat Trump in the Electoral College. Biden’s combined margin of victory was just 44,000 votes out of nearly 11.7 million cast in Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin, the three states that handed him the presidency. He carried each state by less than one percentage point and fell short of 50 percent of the vote in all three. Trump won the 2016 presidency by less than 80,000 combined votes in the swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.It’s far too early to say what the national political mood will look like in two years but, in a deeply polarized political climate and closely divided country, the next presidential race could well be as close as the last two have been.And both Biden and Trump are rather unpopular. Biden’s job approval rating currently hovers around 40 percent in national polls—slightly worse than where Trump’s was heading into the midterms four years ago and the lowest of any president at this point in his presidency since WWII. Those numbers have been driven down by sky-high inflation and a darkening economic climate that has put Democrats in a bad position heading into the midterms.Trump’s poll numbers aren’t any better. Early head-to-head surveys suggest that Biden and Trump would begin the 2024 race in a dead heat. But as the 2022 midterms indicate, voters seem to prefer Biden with all his economic baggage to Trump’s brand of chaos."

Hingeley confirmed that Jones is facing two counts of malicious wounding in connection to the injuries sustained by Hollins and Morgan.A bullet hole through the window of a tour bus where the players were killed and two others injuredHis father has said Jones Jr. was 'paranoid' and said people had been 'picking on him' weeks before his campus gun rampageUniversity President Jim Ryan said at a news conference Monday that authorities did not have a 'full understanding' of the motive or circumstances of the shooting.Authorities also said it is unclear how Jones was able to flee the shooting scene, and was tracked down hours later.University officials say Jones had previously come to the attention of the school's threat-assessment team this fall in the context of a review of a 'potential hazing issue.'During that review, university officials heard from a student that Jones made a comment about having a gun.That student did not report Jones making any threat, according to the statement.University officials investigated and subsequently discovered Jones had previously been tried and convicted of a misdemeanor concealed weapons violation in 2021, but the person who reported Jones to the police did not witness him with the weapon firsthand.Luke Sommers takes a moment to himself as he gathers for a candlelight vigil after a shooting that left three students dead the night before at the University of VirginiaJones facing three counts of second-degree murder and three counts of using a handgun in the commission of a felonyUniversity of Virginia students bowed their heads as they took time to say prayers for those affected by the shootingAnd when the school looked into the February 2021 allegation and checked in with Jones' roommates, none could confirm that they had ever seen him with a gun.But in the aftermath of the shooting that gripped northern Virginia, Jones' father said he was a 'sensitive young man' that seemed excited to celebrate his 23rd birthday on Thursday.Christopher Darnell Jones Sr. also expressed his disbelief that his son was involved, and said he wished to speak with his son face-to-face so he can find answers - while insisting that he is 'not a bad kid.Jones Sr. said he separated from his wife and son when Jones Jr. was still a young boy. But when Jones Jr. stopped getting on with his mother, he moved in with Jones Sr. and his grandmother in Petersburg.There, he played football for Petersburg High School and 'excelled', Jones Sr. said, telling the news outlet that he was 'everyone's friend.''Everybody loved Chris, and he had a movie star smile he would flash,' he said.The names of the three students who were shot and killed can be seen together with the message 'UVA Strong'The vigil was held after officials revealed following his arrest that Jones Jr. was already known to police, having been on their radar since September over a 'hazing investigation'. Pictured: UVa Police Chief Tim Longo gives an update on the shootingUniversity officials said Jones had previously come to the attention of the school's threat-assessment team this fall in the context of a review of a 'potential hazing issue'However, last time he spoke with his son, Jones Sr. said something was wrong. His son has seemed normal when they spoke. But the last time he visited, they just 'sat and talked'.Jones Jr. also told his father that some people had been 'giving him a hard time', but that he was still 'upbeat'.During their search for Christopher Darnell Jones Jr., police swarmed his mother's house. He wasn't there, however. It is not clear whether he was trying to reach his family before being arrested.NBC12 reported seeing his mother sobbing in her car, later telling the outlet that she had tried to call her son several times but was unable to reach him on his phone.Jones had once been on the football team, but he had not been part of the team for at least a year. The UVA football website listed him as a team member during the 2018 season and said he did not play in any games.Hours after Jones was arrested, first-year head football coach Tony Elliott sat alone outside the athletic building used by the team, at times with his head in his hands. He said the victims 'were all good kids.''These precious young men were called away too soon. We are all fortunate to have them be a part of our lives.'They touched us, inspired us and worked incredibly hard as representatives of our program, university and community,' he said in a statement.Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usualWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

2584,buses road workers,"Private buses keep off road as workers, owners join strike","The deserted Vyttila Mobility Hub in the wake of the strike called by Ernakulam district private bus operators in protest against the alleged harassment by enforcement authorities.
| Photo Credit: H. VIBHUWorkers and owners of around 1,400 private buses, serving Kochi and its immediate neighbourhoods, joined a token strike on Wednesday against the alleged highhandedness by the police and the Motor Vehicles department (MVD) against bus workers, resulting in the creation of an atmosphere of tension among them.The situation is such that the police are foisting false cases against private bus workers so that even bus owners, along with workers, are being called into account, said K.B. Suneer, general convenor of Ernakulam District Bus Owners’ and Workers’ Combined Forum, which called for the token strike. The strike was total, said a statement from the organisers.Since buses remained off the road, attendance at educational institutions was affected. However, operation of industrial units was not hit. Shops and business establishments, including hotels and outlets in the Ernakulam main market, operated as usual, though a hotelier said workers were late to take up duties owing to shortage of public transport facilities.The protesters also took out a march to the office of the District Police Chief (Kochi City) to register their protest. They also organised a dharna in front of the police chief’s office. There was heavy police guard in areas through which the march passed from High Court Junction.The agitators demanded that the police and the MVD take action against those guilty of wrongdoing instead of accusing bus workers even in small cases and turning them into police complaints. Bus operators demanded bus ways as well as an end to what they claimed was “physical assault” by the police.Meanwhile, strike organisers said if their pleas failed to get a positive response, they would be forced to resort to an indefinite stir from November 30. K.A. Najeeb of Bus Operators’ Association, INTUC national secretary K.P. Haridas, and AITUC district president John Lukose were among those who addressed protesters.

2659,lankans skipping meals,Sri Lankans are skipping meals as food prices surge,"Food inflation rose to 94.9% in September, making survival worse for poor families.Survival of the fittestPhoto: DINUKA LIYANAWATTE (Reuters)ByMalaka RodrigoUpdatedSunday 10:40PMThe principal of the Ganthalawa school in the rural village of Kanthale, Sri Lanka, received an unusual request from a female student—she wanted to change her class because her classmate had stopped sharing meals with her and she hoped to find someone else who might be willing to share food during school meal times.The girl’s father, a laborer, was out of work as a result of Sri Lanka’s economic meltdown and the whole family often went to bed hungry. Any food shared by a willing classmate was vital for Amaya (name changed) to survive.AdvertisementAccording to a report (pdf) on Sri Lanka by the Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission, run jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP), two in every five households had their incomes reduced by more than 50% compared to the corresponding three-month period in 2021.Graphic: Food and Agriculture Organization, World Food Programme, September 2022.Labourers like Amaya’s father and those working in the agriculture sector found themselves caught in a pincer of lack of employment and soaring food prices.Food inflation reached 94.9% in September, a devasting blow to poor families already struggling with meals every day. Rice, the staple in Sri Lanka, now costs 210 rupees ($0.57) per kilogram, more than double the rate at which it was selling last year at Rs100. Chicken, which was selling at Rs680 per kilogram last year, now sells at Rs1,465.AdvertisementGraphic: Central Bank of Sri Lanka, 2022Sri Lanka started floating the US dollar in February, which jumped to over Rs350 against Rs200 in the previous year. A litre of diesel now costs Rs510, twice what it cost earlier this year when it was just Rs254 back in March this year.Sri Lanka banned agrochemicals in April 2021 to promote organic farming and to cut on fertilizer importation. But this exercise backfired as organic fertilizer was not as productive as the use of chemical fertilizers. It is expected this would result in a decline of yields, particularly of rice and corn, by about 40% in 2022, according to the FAO-WFP food security assessment.The report also said approximately 8.7 million people (39.1% of the population) were not consuming an adequate diet. The situation has worsened since the third quarter of 2021 when the Medical Research Institute, a government health research agency, found only 3.4% of households taking in an adequate diet.AdvertisementAround 60% of households are adopting coping strategies because they did not have enough food or money to buy food. Nearly a fourth of households had reduced the number of meals consumed daily and close to half reported limiting portion sizes. Worst-hit among the estate workers are those coming from tea plantations that are already under the poverty line where four in every five households (79.1%) were regularly skimping on food.Prices have gone up and customers dried down.Photo: Fonny de Fonseka“We still manage all three daily meals for the kids, but my husband and I make do with two meals, skipping breakfast and having brunch before noon,” Kalani Salgado, a working mother who has two school-going children, told SciDev.Net. “We used to buy fish and meat regularly, but now we can afford these items only a few times a month.”Other coping strategies included dipping into savings, buying food on credit, borrowing money, or pawning jewellery. Once these strategies were exhausted, households resorted to further tighter measures, impacting their capacity to generate incomes. The FAO-WFP report indicated that by June 2022, about 23% of Sri Lankan households had taken to selling productive assets such as farming equipment or vehicles, reducing essential healthcare expenses, and withdrawing children from school.AdvertisementAs household purchasing power dwindles, the worry is malnutrition. According to the Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission, the nutritional content of diets consumed by households was poor, with diets in the worst-off households lacking protein and iron-rich foods.Pregnant and lactating mothers as well as children were the most vulnerable. In November 2021, the country stopped distributing Thriposha, a nutritional supplement meant for pregnant and lactating women and children. The budget for school meals was cut by two-thirds in January 2022, seriously impacting the scheme.“Government understands the dire situation and is trying to put some remedy to slow the impact and has already prepared Emergency Nutrition Plan (pdf) 2022—2024,” says Ranjith Batuwanthudawe, the head of the Health Promotion Bureau of the Ministry of Health. “We do plan to focus on district-level strategies to address the issues of any malnutrition situation and food security,” he said.Some relief does come from donors and social activists. After learning of Amaya’s story, a temple in the region came forward to arrange food for the students of the Ganthalawe school and others in the area.AdvertisementIn response to the ongoing crisis, the WFP implemented an emergency operation in June with a goal to provide food and nutrition assistance to 3.4 million people. This support includes the distribution of emergency food assistance–such as cash, vouchers and food commodities–to 1.4 million people, helping families access a nutritious diet.The WFP will also assist the Sri Lankan government in its national school meal programme by providing rice so that one million children will continue to receive their daily meals in schools. They will also procure key ingredients – maize and soya – for the production of Thriposha so that one million young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women continue to receive this nutritional supplement.Meanwhile, a ‘community kitchen’ programme was initiated by the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement, a local non-profit organisation that has focused on alleviating poverty since 1958. Under this concept, the community pools resources and cook meals with materials donated by the community or outside donors.Healthy meal ready to be served in a “community kitchen”Photo: Sarvodaya Shramadana MovementAdvertisement“Because of covid-19, at least 500,000 had fallen below the level of poverty and the present economic crisis pulled thousands more into poverty so that what is now a social crisis can quickly escalate into a humanitarian crisis,” says Vinya Ariyarathne, general secretary of Sarvodaya.The community kitchen is not a new concept and was successfully implemented during the global 1972 food crisis, says Malani Balasooriya, coordinator for Sarvodaya, which is also setting up village food banks and exploring the potential of home gardening and community farming to cultivate basic food items.Sri Lanka’s situation is critical, but not insurmountable, says Vimlendra Sharan, FAO representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives. “At FAO we are working to boost agriculture production and protect the most vulnerable farmers and fishers from the worst impacts of the crisis so that they are not compelled to abandon their livelihoods,” he said.If Sri Lanka invests in technology, innovation, and evidence-based decision-making, the country can make significant strides toward becoming a food-secure nation in the future, Sharan says. Sustainable practices that increase yields while managing costs and protecting natural resources are key, the FAO representative added.AdvertisementIn the short term, though, the food security situation is expected to worsen from October 2022 to February 2023 as domestic production declines and the country lacks the hard currency needed to import food.“As the whole world is engulfed in various crises, Sri Lanka needs to stride carefully and not to let the situation escalate into a humanitarian crisis,” warns Ariyarathne."

1629,cop27 greta activists,"COP27: Without Greta, activists make waves at climate summit","Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg has skipped the Sharm el-Sheikh meeting, calling it a forum for ""greenwashing"".But young people from countries at high risk from climate change say they are ""calling it out"" from inside.In an address on Tuesday, climate activist Vanessa Nakate from Uganda will tell governments to wash their ""oil-stained"" hands.Speaking to G20 nations, she will tell ministers that they must end the ""moral and economic madness"" of funding fossil fuels and prioritising short-term politics.Activists from developing countries say they agree with Thunberg that COP is compromised by the large presence of oil and gas delegates.But they say their work has an impact here.Ayisha Siddiqa, 23, is from Pakistan, is one of the headline speakers at the Children and Youth Pavilion. It's the first time young people have had a dedicated space like this, where last week activists held a formal meeting with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.Image caption,Ayisha Siddiqa (left) helped Fearless Collective paint a mural at the first Youth Pavilion at a COP summitIt's one of the most buzzing areas of COP27, with activists jostling to find space to sit and chat on the floor, and Ayisha tells me she's proud of the space.""This is for the youth, organized by us. Unlike government and business areas, there's no corporate branding everywhere,"" she says.She says questions about Greta miss the point about the reality of climate change. This summer, devastating floods killed 1,700 people in her home country Pakistan. ""The world has come to an end for people… For me, the stakes are so high that I can't just give up hope for change,"" she says.Kenyan Mana Omar, 27, worries the summit will not deliver the climate finance that her country needs - calling COP27 more like a ""trade fair"".But she still travelled here to represent her nomadic community severely affected by drought. ""My community are missing here, their voices are totally unheard, they live in areas with no internet. I just hope I can do my best to bring their message here,"" she explains.Image caption,Mana OmarShe says her role is to have ""hope where there is none"" and she wants a better future for her one-year-old daughter.But many activists, particularly from developing nations, say they faced significant barriers in coming to the summit in Egypt.Imran Hussein, from Bangladesh, lost his father in cyclone Aila in 2009 and says he is extremely worried about sea level rise in his costal home. He is at COP to get ""climate justice"" for his mother, who has worked in a garment factory since Imran's father died.Imran and his colleague Sohanur Rahmen explain they got grants for travel and hotels, but they cannot afford to eat at the conference.Delegates faced costs of about $4,000 a week for accommodation, as well as the costs of travel and visas.Activists say future climate summits must include special funds and accommodation for young people from civil society.Image caption,Imran and Sohanur say they can hold their government to account at meetingsBut, waving their passes, Imran and Sohanur are proud they have been given spaces on Bangladesh's negotiating team.It gives them access to conversations behind-the-scenes where countries stake out their positions on the final agreements.Negotiations between countries on how to curb climate change will go on for the rest of the week, with reports suggesting a large gap remains between rich and poor nations.Youth activists are hopeful they will secure more money for communities devastated by climate change, and a firm commitment from leaders to radically phase out fossil fuels. But most admit they will probably have to come back next year.The COP27 global climate summit in Egypt is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. More than 200 countries are attending the summit to discuss further measures to cut emissions and prepare for climate change, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives."
2458,best iphone 14,Best iPhone 14 Fast Chargers at the Lowest Prices We Can Find,"With Apple not including a power adapter with any of the iPhone 14 models (or iPhone 13 models), here's a look at several chargers that will quickly juice up any iPhone.David CarnoyNov. 12, 2022 12:00 a.m. PTDavid CarnoyExecutive Editor / ReviewsExecutive Editor David Carnoy has been a leading member of CNET's Reviews team since 2000. He covers the gamut of gadgets and is a notable reviewer of mobile accessories and portable audio products, including headphones and speakers. He's also an e-reader and e-publishing expert as well as the author of the novels Knife Music, The Big Exit and Lucidity. All the titles are available as Kindle, iBooks, Nook e-books and audiobooks.Every year, Apple's new iPhones become more and more advanced, yet they still don't include everything you need in the box. Apple has removed accessories from the box little by little over the years, and nowadays, you pretty much just get a cable and that's it -- how long until you don't even get that? That's why you should invest in a high-quality fast charger that you can keep and continue to use as you upgrade your phone.Apple's 20-watt USB-C power adapter sells for $18, which is about $11 less than its overpriced and discontinued 18-watt USB-C power adapter. But several attractive alternatives can be considered among the best iPhone chargers. We've rounded up some of our favorite Apple device chargers to give a boost to your battery life. A few quick ground rules before we start:You'll need a charger with a USB-C port, or you'll need to get a USB-A-to-USB-C adapter. At the prices below, you might as well just get a new charger for your Apple product.Chargers with USB-C or PD (power delivery) support can generally charge devices faster than chargers with USB-A ports.Two ports are always better than one, allowing you to charge two phones at once, or a phone and an accessory like wireless headphones.Higher wattage is better up to a point. But getting 18 watts or better will allow you to charge tablets and even a Nintendo Switch. Get 65 watts or more and you can charge most newer laptops, too.Many of these new chargers use a new, fast semiconductor material called gallium nitride, aka GaN, that is replacing the old, slow, silicon chip. Chargers with ""GaNFast"" have a charging speed up to three times faster than traditional chargers -- and they're half the size and weight. They're compatible with everything in today's Apple range, from AirPods and iPhones all the way to the big 16-inch MacBook Pro. They might not be optimal for models older than the iPhone 12, though.Every charger here can also juice up an Android phone (so long as you supply a compatible charging cord or USB cable) as well as a Nintendo Switch.While there are a plethora of charging brands available, including some generic ones on Amazon that offer 20-watt USB-C chargers for as low as $12 for a three-pack, we can broadly recommend three phone-charger brands: Anker, Aukey and RAVPower. All three have similar offerings at similar wattage, and prices fluctuate almost daily. Our latest Apple iPhone favorites are below, including some power bank (battery), wireless, charging stand and car options. We've used all of these over the past few months (or their direct predecessors).We've tested most, but not all, of these chargers with the previous-generation iPhone 12 and iPhone 13. We'll update this periodically with more current picks for the new iPhone 14 so you can find a great deal to stay powered up.The Anker Nano II 30W is a next-generation fast charger powered by gallium nitride (GaN II) technology. It's about the same size as the original 20W Nano charger but delivers more fast charging power. The Nano II will not only charge your phone but a MacBook Air, iPad, and other Apple devices. Anker also sells 45- and 65-watt chargers. Read our first take on Anker Nano II chargers.Anker's Nano is literally the size of old Apple's 5-watt USB charger that used to ship with iPhones but offers 20-watt charging. Featuring Anker's PowerIQ 3.0 technology, it charges more than 2.5x faster than that 5-watt charger (with a USB-C-to-Lightning cable). It was recently upgraded from 18 to 20 watts.A GaNFast charger, Spigen's 20-watt ArcStation Pro is one of the smallest fast charging USB-C chargers you'll find. While the Anker Nano is a bit smaller, it doesn't have a foldable plug like this model. Using a USB-C-to-Lightning cable, it charges close to three times faster than Apple's standard 5-watt USB charger.This 30-watt dual-port charger delivers the full 30 watts of juice if used alone and 18 watts if used while charging a second device via the USB-A port, which delivers 12 watts of charging. It's a GaNFast charger, and it includes a USB-C to Lightning cable. It's on sale for $26, and you can save an extra 30% when you use the promo code NL144 at checkout.This svelte Anker 30-watt charger with foldable plugs is pocket friendly and can charge your iPhone impressively fast with a USB-C-to-Lighting cable. Like many other compact chargers, this uses gallium nitride (or GaN) technology.I originally had an Aukey cigarette-lighter power adapter on this list, but it's out of stock and this low-profile Ainope mini fast USB Car Charger offers even faster charging (up 24 watts) and costs less. It has both a USB-C and USB-A port so you can charge two devices at the same time, but to get 15-watt wireless charging, you're going to be better off charging one device.Yes, a 100-watt charger is overkill for charging your phone. But if you want a charger that can charge any USB-C laptop, including the 16-inch MacBook Pro (which happens to be my work computer), the new Baseus 100W GaN II Fast Charger with Qualcomm Quick Charge 5.0 is the latest and greatest high-wattage fast charging USB-C charger. As its name implies, it features GaN II technology. It's both significantly smaller than earlier 100-watt chargers and more energy efficient, so it doesn't heat up as much. It adapts to whatever device you're charging, delivering the highest charging speed that the device is capable of.Nimble is all about making its products from recycled plastics, and not having any plastic in its packaging. Its Wally Mini is a dual-port 20-watt PD charger with fast-charging capabilities. You can charge two devices at once, but to get to top charging speed for your iPhone you'll need to connect it using a USB-C-to-Lightning cable (to the USB-C port) without having any other devices connected to the USB-A port.It has retractable prongs, is quite compact and also feels pretty light. If you didn't know it was made out of recycled plastic, you might not guess that it was. But since I did know, I did think, ""Yes, this feels like recycled plastic."" Not that it feels bad, but it does look and feel a little different.Nimble also includes a bag in the box for your e-waste items. If your old electronics product is on Nimble's list of approved electronics for recycling, you can print out a free shipping label to send in your gear for recycling.No, this isn't a fancy new MagSafe charger -- but it doesn't cost $60, either. I like this RAVPower charging pad because it's relatively inexpensive and comes with a power adapter that allows you to get the faster 10-watt wireless charging speeds (some top out at 7.5 watts, and a lot of cheap wireless charging pads don't include a power adapter).Another good choice in the best all-around wall charger category is RAVPower's 65-watt dual-port charger. It's very similar to the Aukey and often costs within a few bucks of the same price. This is also a GaNFast charger.Why carry around both a power adapter and a portable battery when you can have both in one device? We loved the earlier version of this model, and now it's back with both USB-A and USB-C ports, with power up to 18 watts. Yes, it's bigger and heavier than most of the power adapters on this list, because it does have that integrated battery.Another GaNFast charge, this compact 65-watt USB-C charger will not only charge your iPhone at maximum speed (if you spring for a USB-C-to-Lightning cable), it also charges most USB-C charging laptops. Additionally, you can charge a second device via the USB-A port.This Power Bank from Aukey has both wired and wireless charging options. If you use the USB-C port, you can get 18 watts of charging. Go wireless and lay your phone on the charging dock battery and it will wirelessly charge at 10 watts, which is where the iPhone currently maxes out for wireless charging. You're paying a premium, but this phone charger unit has a massive battery (20,000 mAh), a built-in kickstand and a digital readout listing the remaining charge. It comes with a USB-A-to-USB-C cable, but you'll need to supply an adapter to charge it."
1472,10 000 5g,"Telcos far behind the 10,000 5G sites per week target","Telecom service providers are still far from meeting the government’s target of deploying 10,000 5G base stations every week, with the top two carriers managing to set up only about a third of the weekly target so far.Telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw asked telcos to ramp up the installation of 5G cell sites from 2,500 a week last month to 10,000 so that 5G services are available at the earliest.Industry executives said the rollout of about 3,500 5G sites a week is in line with supplies from telecom network gear providers. Production capacity is being ramped up to meet demand, they added.“Our 5G network rollout is happening as per plan. We are rolling out 1,500–1,600 sites a week. We plan to ramp up as equipment supplies increase,"" an Airtel spokesperson said, adding that the telco has rolled out 5G in Gurugram on Tuesday.Airtel acquired over 1 million 5G customers since it launched the services in eight cities in early October.A Reliance Jio spokesperson said Jio is on track to complete the pan-India deployment of 5G by December next year. “We are ahead of plans at this stage. We are deploying over three times more 5G cells every week than others, and the pace is picking up on a daily basis. However, we are launching services in an area only after substantial coverage is achieved and not with the mere presence of a radiating tower.""India’s largest telecom service provider Reliance Jio started 5G services early last month via an invite-only beta launch in key metros. Last week, Jio extended 5G coverage to Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Network equipment makers Nokia and Ericsson said they were increasing local production to meet demand. More than 95% of the telecom service providers’ requirements of 5G telecom gear were being met by the local production capacities of the European gear providers, executives said.Nokia India’s Chennai facility meets domestic demand for network equipment, besides exports. Ericsson India has tied up with contract manufacturer Jabil Circuits to build its local production capacity. However, a section of industry insiders said setting up 10,000 sites a week may take time as more production lines have to be set up.“Even at 3,500 sites in a week, it isn’t a slow pace of rollout. Whatever production is being done at the local factories of vendors is being deployed for telcos. In a few weeks, when the number of sites increases, it will be perhaps the fastest 5G rollout anywhere in the world,"" a senior executive of a vendor firm said, seeking anonymity.According to the government, 10,000 base stations per week is a realistic target, and the department of telecommunications was providing all necessary support.“It’s not a hard and fast goal that they have to do 10,000 a week, and we understand that it won’t be a linear curve of rollouts, and we’re aware of the issues that they have to get equipment and provide connectivity,"" a senior official said, asking not to be named.“We’re supporting them in every way, but if they scale up earlier, the increase (in coverage) will be exponential,"" he said, adding that the real push in rollouts is expected to be seen January-February onwards.To be sure, carriers have to comply with rollout obligations set out in the license conditions issued by the government for any technology or service. For the 700 MHz band, DoT has set the coverage of 10% of district headquarters or towns in non-metros and 40% of a metro area by the end of the first year from the date of the license. The 700 Mhz band is being used by Jio for 5G standalone or SA. For the 3.5 GHz band, which is being used by Airtel for 5G non-standalone or NSA, the commercial launch of 5G services must take place in one town in a non-metro area and anywhere in a metro area, by the end of the first year of receiving the licence.Gulveen Aulakh is Senior Assistant Editor at Mint, serving dual roles covering the disinvestment landscape out of New Delhi, and the telecom & IT sectors as part of the corporate bureau. She had been tracking several government ministries for the last ten years in her previous stint at The Economic Times.

4012,trump ally lost,"Anthony Scaramucci, Former Trump Ally, Lost Money in FTX Collapse","The abrupt implosion of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, valued at $32 billion in February, resonated like an earthquake in the crypto industry and business circles.Overnight, many retail and institutional investors lost their money. It will undoubtedly take many months to assess the damage caused and draw up the list of casualties.Crypto lender BlockFI is about to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The firm had been bailed out by FTX and its founder and former CEO Bankman-Fried during the liquidity crisis that affected the sector last summer, after the collapse of sister cryptocurrencies Luna and UST, or TerraUSD.""We do have significant exposure to FTX and associated corporate entities that encompasses obligations owed to us by Alameda, assets held at FTX.com, and undrawn amounts from our credit line with FTX.US,"" BlockFi said on November 14.Venture capital firm Sequoia Capital said it lost $210 million to FTX, while the Japanese firm Softbank has quantified its losses at $100 million.Another big name in business circles has in turn revealed that he is affected by this debacle, with the bankruptcy filing of FTX on November 11 for lack of a savior.""You lost money?"" Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of alternative investment company SkyBridge Capital, was asked at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore on November 15.""I actually didn’t lose the money because Sam [Bankman-Fried] gave me the money,"" said Scaramucci, whose nickname is The Mooch. ""But yes we lost money in general because the overall portfolio is going down as a result of this debacle, so yes I guess yes.""At the time, SkyBridge, which started out as a traditional hedge fund before pivoting into cryptocurrencies with investments in bitcoin (BTC) and other coins, saw its bets into digital assets turn sour.SkyBridge had bet that BTC will reach $100,000 per unit. But the fall in the price of the cryptocurrency has undercut this bet, and specifically, it has made smaller funds, like Legion Strategies, vulnerable.The Legion Strategies fund suspended withdrawals by its investors last July.The exodus of investors also affected Skybridge Capital's flagship fund, Skybridge Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios, which had $2 billion under management at the end of March.Bankman-Fried and FTX were also the main sponsor of the annual SALT conference, organized by SkyBridge, which brings together hedge funds. They signed a 3-year contract. The Mooch also revealed that he was in the Middle East -- Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi -- recently with Bankman-Fried who wanted to raise new money.""I think it is very hard to protect yourself against that sort of misrepresentation,"" Scaramucci said about revelations that Bankman-Fried may have altered his firm’s balance sheet. ""If you’ve been shown a balance sheet that may or may not be accurate; if you've been shown income statements that may or may not be accurate, that have been validated by third parties that s pretty rough, that’s very hard to see through.""He continued: ""If you are running a background check on someone like Sam you are not going to find anything, he was unblemished, if you will, prior to this incident.""""He was giving me the money I was looking and I was doing a lot of due diligence on him, but clearly not enough; so it’s important to explain that to people, to share that with people.""The Mooch indicated on November 11, in an interview with CNBC, that he was planning to buy back his equity in SkyBridge from FTX. But he didn't provide additional details during that interview how he will finance the deal. Does SkyBridge has enough cash for the transaction, given the fact that the firm was bailed out only two months ago?The other point is also that the assets of FTX were seized or transferred as part of the bankruptcy. And it is not certain that during the liquidation, SkyBridge will have a say.FTX faces a shortfall of $1.7 billion, one source told Reuters, while another source said that between $1 billion and $2 billion were missing. Bankman-Fried, who resigned as CEO on November 12, was once hailed as the savior of the sector during the liquidity crisis of last summer.FTX's financials also showed that there was a ""back door"" in the books, created with ""bespoke software,"" according to the news outlet. It was described as a way for Bankman-Fried to alter the firm's financial records without raising any alerts."
3345,trump presidential announcement,"Donald Trump presidential announcement speech: golden age, less rage","Donald Trump has announced he will run for president again in 2024. (Image: AP/Andrew Harnick)As announcements go it was somewhat more muted than the last. In June 2015 Donald Trump, then host of The Apprentice, descended on a golden escalator in New York skyscraper that bears his name to proclaim his intention to run for President – for real this time.The businessman had previously floated the idea of running for the White House but never actually followed through, and back then his candidacy was seen as something of a joke. The rest, as they say, is history.Mr Trump served one tumultuous term as commander-in-chief before being resoundingly ousted in the 2020 election, a plebiscite which the billionaire continues to claim, without evidence, was rigged against him.This time the setting was a conference room at his Mar-a-Lago resort – which was raided by the FBI earlier this year - the 76-year-old stepping up to the podium to chants of “U-S-A! U-S-A!”. He began by speaking directly to his base, praising the MAGA (Make America Great Again) crowd as “the heart and soul of this incredible movement and greatest country in the history of the world” and saying there had “never been anything like it and perhaps there will never be anything like it again”.Hitting familiar notes, Mr Trump told the crowd “America’s comeback starts right now”, insted the country had “stood ready for its golden age” when he left office in 2020 and made references to “vanquishing all enemies”.There were, of course, copious references to the former president’s bete noire on the international stage, China, which he claimed played a “big role” in the 2020 election before saying, with apparent sarcasm, “I’m sure that didn’t happen”. Mr Trump claimed to have been the first president to impose tariffs on the Far Eastern country. The U.S has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries.The 76-year-old went on to claim he had “kept his promises” from his first election campaign. That included building a wall on the southern border and making Mexico pay for it – according a report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Mr Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed along the 2,000 mile border. Mexico did not pay for construction. Nevertheless the former president claimed “we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more”.Donald Trump (Image: AP)His penchant for hyperbole undimmed, Mr Trump described the withdrawal from Afghanistan as “perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country”, falsely claiming $85bn of equipment was left behind. He further claimed the war in Ukraine “would never have happened if I were your president”.While he hit on familiar points – election fraud, “radical left lunatics”, making America great again – Mr Trump’s speech was notably more polished than his 2015 announcement. On that occasion he branded Mexican immigrants rapists, branded a soldier captured in Afghanistan “a no-good traitor”, plugged his golf courses and compared China’s leadership to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots playing against, in the Obama administration, a high school football team.On Tuesday the former commander-in-chief read from a prompter, rather than the freewheeling style of 2015 and which is so often seen at his rallies. Even his customary mention of the ‘fake news media’ was couched as a joke, Mr Trump stating that he would keep things ‘elegant’.Was this an attempt to out-flank ‘Trump with a brain’ Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida widely tipped to run for 2024? It was a full 18 minutes before the defeated 2020 candidate officially announced his intention to run again, to wild cheers from the floor.How the speech will play outside of Mr Trump’s base remains to be seen – this was a message for MAGA. Appearing to make a veiled reference to the events of January 6 2020 he told attendees “this is our country, our government, and the corridors of power are our corridors… we’re coming to take those corridors back”. There was plenty of talk about the border, about the death penalty for drug dealers, about Joe Biden's mental state - just in less of a free-flowing, off-kilter way than we've become used to.The former president remains hugely popular with Republican voters – a recent poll put his approval at 80 per cent – and remains favourite to be the party’s nominee for 2024. Playing the hits for the converted is one thing though, will his message play with a general electorate which already rejected Mr Trump in 2020? Tuesday lacked the fire and fury of 2015 – but Mr Trump was almost entirely written off then too.Share2 CommentsIt should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse.heraldscotland.com is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

1735,mastodon twitter alternative,"What’s The Deal With Mastodon, The Twitter Alternative?","Hundreds of thousands of people have flocked to Twitter alternatives after Elon Musk’s takeover of the social media giant became real last week, opening up a can of worms surrounding verification, online venom and privacy. One of the major players so far is a 6-year-old site called Mastodon that’s been booming among journalists, academics and communities that have left Twitter en masse.So what’s Mastodon all about, why is it different than Twitter, and who is it for?Mastodon was created in 2016 by Eugen Rochko, a 29-year-old German coder, as a decentralized replacement for Twitter. The social network has timelines where you can see messages posted by other users you follow. But notably, its servers aren’t based in one place or owned by one company.AdvertisementRather, Mastodon has a huge number of servers, or “instances,” that anyone can set up. The software is open-source, and Rochko is adamant it will never be for sale.The moderators of each server — which can be based around professions, hobbies, geography, anything really — are able to control the group’s guidelines, filtering out spam, trolls or certain types of content. If a user isn’t happy with the server, they’re easily able to switch to another one that better suits what they want.It’s ad-free, and there are no algorithms that place certain messages higher or lower in the timelines based on popularity or some tech magic. All posts are chronological, from earliest to latest.Joining Mastodon is definitely more complicated than the relatively simple Twitter sign-up process. If you’re interested, you have to find a server that seems interesting to you, or that you’ll jive with on some level.

More are being added all the time, or you can start your own and keep it as small or let it grow as big as you like. (Running your own server does cost a small fee, which many instances crowdsource).Looks like hosting your own Mastodon server is going to cost less than paying for a blue checkmark on Twitter. Except when you pay to host your own Mastodon server, you own your data, identity, and social graph fully.Anyone familiar with Twitter will recognize a lot of Mastodon’s features with different, albeit sillier names. A post is called a “toot,” a retweet is called a “boost,” and you can favorite via the star icon.Mentions and hashtags work similarly, and you can add photos, videos or other attachments to your toots. Users are also able to edit their posts and send targeted messages to specific groups of people, sending them to just your followers rather than your whole instance, for example.The Mastodon homepage looks a lot like Twitter, with server-specific ""Local"" and ""Federated"" channels that help you discover other users you might be interested in.HuffPostYou can write messages that your followers can see in their main feeds. But there are also other channels: The Local channel shows messages from anyone in your server. The Federated channel is a broader channel that shows all public posts the server you’re on knows about. Most of those come from people that other users on your server follow, and it’s meant to be a way to discover “potentially interesting content.”You can share messages with your entire instance publicly, or target them to specific groups.The number of people who switched over to #Mastodon in the last week alone has surpassed 230 thousand, along with many returning to old accounts bumping the network to over 655 thousand active users, highest it's ever been!Kathy Griffin is on there after she was suspended for impersonating Musk on Twitter.

4752,dell laptop hiding,Is this Dell laptop hiding the future of PC memory? Meet CAMM,"If you look at the exterior of the Dell Precision 7670, you might mistake it for a chunky corporate laptop from 15 years ago. There’s nothing in the dull grey exterior that indicates it’s hiding technology that might just revolutionize the PC market. But crack that sucker open with Gordon in the latest PCWorld video, and you might just be shocked at what’s hiding inside.This laptop is one of the first models on the market to use a brand new standard for memory, CAMM, which we’ve covered in depth when the concept was introduced. That stands for Compression Attached Memory Module, which replaces the DIMM and SO-DIMM standard that’s been used in laptops and desktops for decades. The new design has a few advantages. While it’s physically larger than a piece of SO-DIMM memory, it’s more spread out, allowing for up to 128GB of memory on a single circuit board.The memory and connection plate are also far, far thinner, with electrical contacts that look more like a processor socket than a traditional memory slot. That’s a huge advantage for laptop builders, which have been leaning into soldered RAM instead of user-accessible SO-DIMM slots for years just to save a few millimeters of Z-height. Dell’s design also minimizes the physical distance between the memory and the CPU.The CAMM design is a little less user-friendly than conventional RAM modules, as it requires you to remove six screws and a stiffening plate (at least on this version) instead of simply popping off a couple of retention clips. But for anyone who feels comfortable popping off the back of their laptop, it’s still fairly straightforward.While the CAMM system is a Dell patent and technically a proprietary format, the company is trying to work with Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC) to license it as a memory standard. Whether any of Dell’s competitors will be willing to hop on the bus (har har) remains to be seen.

428,weinstein trial defense,Weinstein trial: defense demands graphic details from Jennifer Siebel Newsom,"Harvey Weinstein’s most prominent accuser faced a grueling cross-examination on Tuesday, as Weinstein’s defense attorney hammered her on details, casting doubt on her memory and demanding clarification on the most graphic details of the alleged rape.It was the second day of testimony from Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a documentary film-maker and the wife of California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and the most high-profile woman so far to take the stand against the Hollywood producer.On Tuesday, she faced a tough cross-examination from Weinstein’s defense team. More than an hour in, as defense attorney Mark Werksman was asking her to define the word “acquiesce”, Siebel Newsom compared the relentless questioning to her interaction with Weinstein himself.“What you’re doing today is exactly what he did to me,” she told Weinstein’s lawyer.Weinstein’s defense team focused on differences in how Siebel Newsom described the alleged assault over interviews with prosecutors in 2020 and in grand jury testimony in 2021, including asking her why she had not immediately told prosecutors that she had touched Weinstein’s penis during the assault.Siebel Newsom said she did not recall what parts of her experience she had described at different times. “I had everything in a box, and I’ve been slowly sharing a little bit at a time, because this is so painful,” she said.When she initially met with a detective and a prosecutor in LA in 2020, Siebel Newsom testified, “I didn’t think I would be considered a victim because I thought I was out of the time period.”She teared up as she said, “I offered to talk to detectives initially to support other women, not to be up here on the witness stand.”Weinstein’s defense attorneys spent hours going through nearly 70 emails Siebel Newsom exchanged with Weinstein in the months and years after the alleged attack. They contrasted her bright tone and multiple requests for in-person business meetings with Weinstein in New York and at film festivals in Toronto and Cannes with her testimony that she had felt fear in her subsequent interactions with Weinstein, and that she had not interacted with him much after the assault.He also highlighted multiple emails she sent out to groups of people, including Weinstein, asking for campaign contributions for Gavin Newsom, her now-husband, during his tenure as mayor of San Francisco.Werksman noted her signatures on different emails Weinstein received, including “warm regards” and “xx”, and flagged that she had once responded within eight minutes to an email from Weinstein about finding a time to meet in New York.Siebel Newsom said she simply did not remember sending most of the emails. “I send hundreds of thousands of emails to people,” she testified.“He ruined my life, I put it in a box, and I was not going to not pursue my entertainment career because of what happened,” she said.Continuing to email Weinstein for normal business meetings to network and promote her films was a way “to take control back from someone who had harmed me and violated me”, she said. “I was trying to not feel like a victim and be able to live my life.”The emails she sent him were not flirtatious, Siebel Newsom said. The text of several of her emails to him suggested setting up meetings with him and a third person, including friends of hers and his wife.Siebel Newsom, who had delivered graphic and tearful testimony on Monday about her alleged rape at a Los Angeles hotel in 2005, was visibly tired on Tuesday, often asking for the last question to be repeated and a few times sighing deeply into the microphone. But she also contested some lines of questioning, saying her words were being taken out of context.Weinstein’s attorney was interrupted by objections that his questioning was too argumentative or not relevant, which Judge Lisa Lench often sustained. In a pointed moment, Werksman asked Siebel Newsom to clarify the nature of sexual “noises” she made during the alleged assault, which she said were intended to get Weinstein to end the attack.When Werksman continued to press her about what the noises sounded like, Siebel Newsom pushed back, saying she would not.“This is not When Harry Met Sally, I’m not doing that,” she said.Before ending his cross-examination, Werksman took a moment to consult quietly with Weinstein himself, who sat silently in the courtroom, before saying he had no further questions. Siebel Newsom did not look in Weinstein’s direction during her testimony.Late in the afternoon, when a prosecutor asked Siebel Newsom to once again confirm whether she had consented during different stages of the alleged assault, Siebel Newsom broke down, saying, “No, no, no, no,” to each question and sobbing.She was still sobbing as the judge dismissed her and she strode quickly from the room.Elizabeth Fegan, an attorney for Siebel Newsom, said in a statement after the testimony that Weinstein’s defense team had “ruthlessly tried to discredit her” but that her client “stood firm”.Siebel Newsom “knew that it might have been easier to keep the memory of her 2005 assault buried” but “she felt an obligation to herself, her family, and most important, to the woman who came forward as well as the women unable to speak out publicly”, Fegan said.Her testimony came as the judge overseeing the Los Angeles trial dropped four of the 11 sexual assault charges against Harvey Weinstein after prosecutors said they would not proceed with the counts involving one of his accusers.Superior court judge Lisa Lench dismissed two counts of forcible rape and two counts of forcible oral copulation against the 70-year-old Weinstein.The move had appeared likely since the trial’s opening statements three weeks ago, when prosecutors only mentioned four women Weinstein was charged with assaulting, leaving out the accuser identified in an indictment as Jane Doe 5.The prosecutors at first kept the charges in place and left open the possibility that the woman would testify, while Weinstein’s defense had sought a definitive decision on the issue.The Los Angeles county district attorney’s office has not provided an explanation for why they opted to leave the woman out of the trial.The remaining charges against Weinstein, who is serving a 23-year sentence for a conviction in New York, are two counts of rape and five other sexual assault counts. He has pleaded not guilty."
636,missile hit polish,"Missile hit on Polish village ‘probably’ a Ukrainian accident, president says","missile that hit a Polish village close to the Ukrainian border was probably fired by Ukrainian forces defending against a Russian missile onslaught, Poland’s president has said.Andrzej Duda said the hit, which killed two people on Tuesday evening, was not an attack on his country by Russia and there is a “high probability” Ukrainian defence forces were involved.Earlier, Rishi Sunak, attending the G20 summit in Bali, joined other western leaders in condemning Moscow’s latest barrage against Ukraine’s infrastructure, which they said was the ultimate cause of the blast.Mr Duda said: “We have no proof at this point to suggest the missile was fired by the Russian side.“Ukraine’s defence was launching their missiles in various directions and it is highly probable that one of these missiles unfortunately fell on Polish territory.His comments were echoed by Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg, who said a “preliminary analysis” suggested it was a Ukrainian air defence missile fired to defend against Russian cruise missile attacks.Speaking after a meeting of alliance ambassadors in Brussels, he added: “But let me be clear, this is not Ukraine’s fault.“Russia bears ultimate responsibility as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine.”The likely attribution of the hit to Ukrainian defence forces will ease some of the tensions which arose in its immediate aftermath.A deliberate attack on Poland, which is a Nato member, would have required a joint response by the alliance, raising the risk of war with Russia.However, speaking at the end of the Bali summit, Mr Sunak said the incident came on a day when Russian fired more than 80 missiles against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.“That was happening at a time when the G20 was gathered, trying to find resolution to some of the world’s challenges, and the same time (Russian President Vladimir) Putin was raining down indiscriminately that volume of missile attack,” he said.“I think it shows utter contempt for the international rules-based system.”In the Commons, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the UK stood ready to provide practical and technical assistance to the continuing Polish investigation.He said the Russian bombardment which led to the incident was “Putin’s revenge” for Russian losses on the battlefield.“He is trying to terrorise the people of Ukraine and break their will by leaving them shivering in cold and darkness. I have no doubt he will be unsuccessful in that endeavour,” he said.Mr Duja said it was “most probably a Russian-made missile” which struck the village of Przewodow ain an area where grain was being dried.The Ukrainian forces still operate some former Soviet and Russian munitions, including S-300 air defence missiles.The news of the strike prompted US President Joe Biden to summon a meeting of G7 and Nato leaders present in Bali – including Mr Sunak – amid fears of a serious escalation.Mr Sunak joined Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau in calls to both Mr Duda and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.The Ukrainian leader condemned the hit as “a very significant escalation” of the war against his country by Russia, but Moscow vehemently denied any involvement in the incident.The Russian defence ministry claimed it was a “deliberate provocation” intended to escalate the conflict.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “We have witnessed another hysterical, frenzied, Russophobic reaction that was not based on any real data.”Mr Stoltenberg said the incident underlined the dangers of the continuing war in Ukraine.“We are constantly assessing our presence in the eastern part of the alliance,” he said.“At the same time, we have no indication that this incident was a result of a deliberate attack on Nato territory and we have no indications that Russia is planning offensive military actions against Nato allies.“I think this demonstrates the dangers connected to the ongoing war in Ukraine but hasn’t changed our fundamental assessment of the threat against Nato allies.”Sign up for exclusive newsletters, comment on stories, enter competitions and attend events."
1546,bangladesh tour december,Ravindra Jadeja returns for Bangladesh tour in December,"Chief selector Chetan Sharma was confident that Bumrah would be ready for the home Tests against Australia in February, but didn't want to rush him back into action for Bangladesh, which is India's penultimate assignment in the World Test Championship.""The selection committtee has to deal with workloada management which we follow very closely,"" he started. ""Now, we tried to hurry up Jasprit Bumrah, we tried to get him with the World Cup coming. And see what has happened? We are without Jasprit Bumrah in the World Cup.""The NCA team and the medical team is looking after him very well. And he will definitely be part and parcel of the team very soon, in. the sense definitely against Australia (series in 2023). But for Bangladesh we are little cautious with Jasprit Bumrah as opposed to like we tried to bring him back early (post Asia. Cup). So we don't want ot do that this time.Meanwhile, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul, all of whom were rested for the New Zealand tour in November following the T20 World Cup, will return for the entire tour of Bangladesh that comprises three ODIs and two Tests. These three, along with Rishabh Pant, Cheteshwar Pujara and Shreyas Iyer are expected to form the bedrock of the batting. Hardik Pandya, who is part of the full tour of New Zealand, has been given a break from the trip to Bangladesh.ESPNcricinfo LtdJadeja aside, the spin department is formidable with the inclusion of R Ashwin, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav, who last played a Test in February 2021.""Our middle order is packed and as per team combination, wickets and conditions, we looked at players who will potentially play in the XI,"" Sharma said, when asked about Vihari's absence. On Rahane, Sharma was clear: ""He needs to score some more runs in domestic cricket.""""The door is not closed on anyone,"" Sharma said. ""Pujara scored runs, he's been picked. Rahane made some runs [in the Duleep Trophy opener], he's been playing domestic cricket and the selectors have been in constant touch with him. If he scores runs, he will definitely be considered.""Among those who narrowly missed out, according to Sharma, was Mumbai's Sarfaraz Khan, who topped the charts in the 2021-22 Ranji Trophy, making 982 runs in nine innings at an average of 122.75. He struck four centuries, including one in the final against Madhya Pradesh. Sarfaraz has also been a regular member in India A's squads for a year now.ESPNcricinfo Ltd""The selectors are giving him [Sarfaraz] a chance wherever there are opportunities,"" Sharma said. ""He was part of the India A squad recently. He is a brilliant player, he also knows that. He's not too far away. Sometimes you may have to work extra harder to come into the team, but otherwise he's done his job. He's a serious contender, there was a lot of discussion and he will definitely get a chance very soon.""In the ODI squad, the selectors continued to persist with Madhya Pradesh's Rajat Patidar and Maharashtra's Rahul Tripathi for possible middle-order slots. Both players have had prolific IPLs for their respective teams and were part of the mix for the home ODIs against South Africa last month.Among the bowlers, Uttar Pradesh left-arm seamer Yash Dayal was among the surprise inclusions for the ODIs. Dayal has previously been part of India's net bowling contingent and is coming off an impressive maiden IPL season with champions Gujarat Titans, for whom he picked up 11 wickets in nine games at an economy of 9.25.India begin the tour of Bangladesh with three ODIs in Mirpur on December 4, 7 and 10, after which they play two Tests in Chattogram (December 14-18) and Mirpur (December 22-26).India are currently in fourth place in the WTC standings, and have a good chance of making the final should they win their remaining six Tests in the cycle. The Bangladesh Tests will be followed by four against Australia early next year."
234,wedding photographer wrestled,Horrific moment wedding photographer is wrestled to the ground and pistol-whipped by armed attackers,"Cell phone footage captured the horrific moment a wedding photographer was wrestled to the ground and pistol-whipped by armed attackers in front of terrified newlyweds.Video posted online shows how two men in dark Nike sweatshirts, face masks and dark sweatpants approached the unidentified photographer in broad daylight at San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts on November 9.It was just one of two assaults on wedding photographers at the Palace of Fine Arts that day, after a recent poll found that a majority of San Franciscans believe their city is going downhill, and a third plan to leave the city within three years.In the video from Wednesday, armed men could be seen trying to grab the photographer's camera and gear from his camera bag — but the would-be victim manages to hold on to his belongings.At that point, the two men start threatening the photographer with their guns, one of which appeared to have been modified for an extended clip.The victim tries to run away, running past the shocked groom in a light colored suit with a red kerchief and his new wife, in a red dress, before he falls on the ground.The groom seemed to try to help the man while he was down, but the armed attackers soon came back, holding him to the ground and whipping him with their gun before they ran off.Shocking video shows the moment two men in dark clothing approached a photographer in broad daylight at San Francisco's Palace of the Fine ArtsThe unidentified victim struggled to free his camera case and equipment from the would-be thieves in front of the newlyweds he was photographingThe groom appeared to try to help the victim after he ran from his attackers and fell nearbyThe attackers held the man to the ground and pistol whipped him before fleeing the sceneAnother video from earlier in the day shows what appears to be the same attackers running off with a camera bag and getting into a white sedan before driving off.Both videos were posted by the Instagram account SFSTREETS415, which claims to be 'Asian hate crime reporters.'San Francisco mayor London Breed, pictured during an interview in February 2022. She is the 45th mayor of the City and County of San FranciscoThey reported that the victim, from Dallas, Texas, was an Asian man. He told ABC 7 he flew into the city for the day to take the couple's engagement photos after they received their wedding certificate.'I was just freaked out,' he said, recounting how he 'tried to protect the client's memories' even as 'the bride was crying the whole time.'The victim - who did not wish to be identified for safety reasons - also says he will never work at the Palace of Fine Arts again, and is encouraging couples to no longer hold photo shoots there.The Palace of Fine Arts, meanwhile, described the assault as 'a very scary situation.''Crime in and around tourist destinations has been on the rise; we see our fair amount of car smash and grabs,' managing director Jason Hoover told the San Francisco Standard.'It is all our hope that the city begins to take a hard look at effective solutions to prevent this type of crime.'It is damaging to our business, but more importantly sets a negative image and perception of SF.'A police department spokesman told the Standard: 'At this time, the investigation is analyzing evidence to positively identify the suspects.'It was just one of two assaults on wedding photographers at the picturesque Palace of Fine Arts last WednesdayIn posting the video over the weekend, SFSTREETS415 called for action to hold the city's woke politicians accountable for a 6.2 percent rise in crime.Per San Francisco Police Department statistics, larceny thefts are up 13.2 percent over last year, while robberies are up 5.4 percent and assaults are up 9.6 percent.Rapes in the city are also up a whopping 9.3 percent over last year, with homicides up 2.1 percent over last year.'San Francisco is a beautiful city, but a lawless city, and we need to take action because enough is enough,' SFSTREETS415 captioned their video. 'How many more Asians and innocent law abiding citizens have to be killed and hurt?'We at SFSTREETS415 need help to get the attention of the powers that be to make changes across the board,' they continued, suggesting they start with SFPD Chief Bill Scott and Mayor London Breed.'The San Francisco residents are sick and tired of the attacks and violence and terrorism on innocent people.'Crime in the iconic city is now up 6.2 percent from last year, driven primarily by a 13.2 percent increase in the number of theftsSome residents revealed last month that they are now arming themselves with baseball bats and stun guns after a new drug rehabilitation facility drew violent addicts to a previously peaceful neighborhood.Residents of the SoMa neighborhood in northeast San Francisco have said that ever since the SoMa RISE drug sobering center opened in June, 'troublemakers' have plagued the neighborhood.They told Fox News that rather than tempering drug usage, the center has done little more than draw heavy users to the neighborhood.'They're letting their clients come out here and get high, go inside and get sober and then get high again,' Sackett told ABC7 of the facility that Mayor Breed' office originally categorized as a 'safe indoor space' for addicts to 'get off the streets.'Officials are now said to be looking for other ways to deal with the growing drug problem plaguing San Francisco streets — without sending drug users to prison.San Franciscans in the SoMa neighborhood have taken to carrying around defensive weapons after a drug 'sobering' clinic moved into the neighborhood. Pictured: Homeless people are seen in San Francisco in JulyThe SoMa RISE clinic was opened in June, with San Francisco Mayor London Breed characterizing it as a place to let addicts get on their feetA homeless drug addict injects fentanyl into his arm near City Hall in in the Tenderloin District of San FranciscoMeanwhile, a recent survey conducted by the San Francisco Chronicle found that two-thirds of San Francisco residents say their city is going downhill.A third also said they plan to leave the city within three years.The survey of 1,653 adults found that 65 percent said the city was declining, while 37 percent said they would live elsewhere in three years. A staggering 84 percent of people aged 65 and over said they are planning to leave.Respondents largely agreed on the city's top problems: Homelessness took first place, followed by public safety and housing costs. Nearly 70 percent said they doubted those problems would get better in the coming three years.One respondent, Dae Echols, 53, told The Chronicle he was 'fed up with the city' and rising prices would likely force him to retire elsewhere. The average rent in San Francisco has risen to $3,750 per month.'I just remember the hippie generation, and it was all about, take care of your friends, brotherly love. And that is totally gone,' said Echols.Other residents hit out at Mayor London Breed, whose earlier popularity for steering the city through the pandemic appears to have waned amid widespread homelessness, property crime, the fentanyl epidemic and other woes.Some 35 percent said Breed had done a poor or very poor job at making San Francisco a better place to live and work these past three years, while 42 percent said she'd done a fair job and 23 percent an excellent or good job.The survey was conducted after the recall election of progressive District Attorney Chesa Boudin, who was ousted in June amid frustration over public safety in the deeply Democratic city.Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usualWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

702,offshore workers strike,Offshore workers strike in dispute over pay,"Unite Scotland said its members on the Petrofac-owned Repsol assets are taking part in a continuous overtime ban and 48-hour stoppage on Wednesday and Thursday.The union said the dispute centres on the removal of a 10% equal time payment, and claims that Petrofac management reneged on a commitment to review benefits in 2020 when it blamed cuts on the downturn in oil and gas prices.It balloted members for industrial action after they rejected a 3% pay offer.Unite has demanded that the 10% cut be reversed, with pay increases reflecting inflationary costs, and that the company fulfils its obligation to review the other payments.Sharon Graham, Unite general secretary, said: “Unite’s members at Petrofac’s Repsol assets have had enough.“This organisation fails to realise that our members are resolute and determined to make sure the promise made back in 2020 to review the pay and benefits is fulfilled and will continue with action until it is.“Unite is 100% with our Petrofac workers in seeking their demands for improvements on pay and benefits.”Around 146 members, including deck crew, pipe fitters, riggers and safety technicians, are involved in the action at 11 locations.A further 48-hour stoppage will take place on November 30 and December 1.Unite regional officer John Boland said: “Unite’s members are due a decent pay rise after years of below-inflation increases and they accepted the word of their employer that they would uphold a commitment to do just that.“However Petrofac have shown their true colours and broken their word and my members will no longer accept jam tomorrow.”A Petrofac spokesman said: “We continue to work closely with our teams and our client to ensure there is no increased risk to safety during periods of industrial action.“Through regular reviews of the remuneration of our offshore workforce, we ensure fair compensation aligned with the market.“Our latest review resulted in enhancements including a salary increase and commitment to an additional increase in January 2023, an equal time allowance, and increased additional and training day payments.”Sign up for exclusive newsletters, comment on stories, enter competitions and attend events."
2507,death inmates,Kuwait puts to death 7 inmates in rare mass execution,"Kuwait on Wednesday put to death seven prisoners in a rare mass execution in the small, oil-rich nation despite facing international criticism over its plans.The state-run KUNA news agency described those executed as all being convicted of premeditated murder and other charges in the sheikhdom. It identified those killed as three Kuwaiti men, one Kuwaiti woman, a Syrian man, a Pakistani man and an Ethiopian woman.Kuwait said the executions took place at its Central Prison. It did not identify the method it used to carry out the executions, though the sheikhdom typically hangs its condemned prisoners. However, it can use firing squads as well.“They deprived the victims of their most sacred rights in this world, which is the right to life,” Kuwait's public prosecution said in a statement.Kuwait hadn't held an execution since 2017, when it similarly carried out a mass execution of seven prisoners, including a ruling family member.Executions are fairly rare in Kuwait, which has the world’s sixth-largest oil reserves. The last before 2017 were carried out in 2013, when a Pakistani, a Saudi and a “Bidoon” — a name used in the emirate for people without citizenship — were hung.The European Union immediately criticized the executions, which it said coincided with a visit by European Commission official Margaritis Schinas to the country.“The EU calls for a halt to executions and for a complete de facto moratorium on carrying out death penalty, as a first step towards a formal and full abolition of the death penalty in Kuwait,” the EU said in a statement, calling the death penalty “a cruel and inhumane punishment.”Schinas separately warned in a statement that the EU “will draw the consequences this will have on discussions on the proposal to put Kuwait on the visa-free list.” The European parliament had been scheduled to vote on the proposal to lift visa requirements for Kuwaitis and those in neighboring Qatar in the EU on Thursday. The EU separately planned to summon Kuwait's ambassador to Brussels.Amna Guellali, an official with Amnesty International, also earlier called for the executions to be halted.“The death penalty is a violation of the right to life and the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment,” she said.Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

384,lauded coming gay,‘Now I feel comfortable’: basketball star Isaac Humphries lauded after coming out as gay,"Isaac Humphries, a Melbourne United player, has been lauded for his courage after publicly coming out and becoming the only openly gay male professional basketball player currently playing in a top tier league, anywhere in the world.In a social media video shot in the locker room in front of his teammates and through a statement released by his club on Wednesday morning, the 24-year-old centre announced he is gay, saying he had been through “extremely dark times” on his journey but is “now happy with who I am”.“I have hidden something about myself my whole life, from everyone I love, and even myself sometimes,” Humphries said. “It is a truth about myself that I have wanted to deny for a long time, but now I feel comfortable in telling you all. That truth, is that I am gay.“I figured out a lot about myself during this most recent off-season, and I have thought about this a lot. I knew if I were to join a team and start a season, I knew I would have to reveal who I am and not hide any more.“I have finally come to a point where I know I can reveal myself as a gay man and still play professional sport.”The Melbourne United chief executive, Nick Truelson, praised his “tremendous courage” and said he hoped Humphries’ bravery would inspire others to follow.“Today is an incredible step in Isaac’s journey, and we as a club are wholeheartedly supportive of him,” Truelson said. “Not only as a member of our club, but as a person. This is a momentous occasion for him personally, but also for male sport on a global scale.”Humphries also received support from the NBL: the league’s commissioner, Jeremy Loeliger, said the player had always been held in the highest regard by the league and it stood with him after the announcement.“Isaac has conducted himself admirably today and over the course of his career, in dealing with what has clearly been a significant cause of distress and consternation for him personally,” Loeliger said.“Basketball is a game that brings people together, and it is no more evident than today.”Dr Erik Denison, research fellow at Monash’s BehaviourWorks research institute, told Guardian Australia he was glad to see widespread support for Humphries, but found the video recorded by him “heart wrenching”.“Professional athletes should not feel they need to make the choice between taking their own lives, dropping out of sport, or coming out to their teammates,” said Denison, who called for more resources to be committed to driving behavioural change in sport.“Leaders in sport need to start taking meaningful steps to stop the very harmful homophobic, sexist, and racist ‘banter’ that remains common,” he said.Pride in Sport, an Australian national not-for-profit inclusion program, acknowledged Humphries’ decision to publicly come out would not have been an easy one to make, given those who do face potential discrimination, but said his bravery should be congratulated.“His journey shows the unfortunate reality that many athletes face when they are not able to enjoy the sport they love as their true selves,” the national program manager for Pride In Sport, Beau Newell, said. “Like Humphries, many athletes self-edit their existence in sport and expend a good deal of their daily energy on hiding their true self from others. His statement highlights the fear that many athletes have in coming out.”"
4413,years prison stabbing,David Bonola is sentenced to 25 years in prison for stabbing death of Queens mom Orsolya Gaal,"Queens handyman David Bonola was sentenced to 25 years today for the brutal stabbing death of a married mother with whom he was having an affair.Bonola, 44, pleaded guilty to manslaughter earlier this month as part of a deal with the Queens District Attorney's Office.In April, he brutally killed Orsolya Gaal in her home, stabbing her more than 50 times while her teenage son was in his bedroom, before stuffing her body in a duffel bag and dragging it several streets away.The pair had been involved romantically but Gaal, who was married, called off the romance.Queens handyman David Bonola was sentenced to 25 years today for the brutal stabbing death of a married mother with whom he was having an affair.David Bonola, 44, accepted a deal from the Queens District Attorney's Office that means he pleads guilty to one count of first degree manslaughter. He stabbed Orsolya Gaal to death and put her body in a duffel bagGaal's body was found inside her son's hockey bag, dumped by the side of a highway not far from her home in QueensDespite admitting to killing her, Bonola was allowed to plead guilty to manslaughter and not murder.

He said that Ukraine is “the party of peace” in the conflict, while Russia is “the party of war.” Russia could end the war by simply withdrawing from Ukraine, he noted. But if Kyiv’s forces stop fighting, “it would be the end of Ukraine,” warned Sullivan.Kherson has been occupied by Russia since the first weeks of the war. But in recent months, fortunes turned sharply against the Kremlin’s forces as Ukrainian troops with advanced weaponry from the U.S. and other NATO nations began to overtake territory in the northeast and south."
2172,count election ballots,Why it takes California so long to count election ballots as House control hangs in the balance,"Ballots are received, sorted and verified at the Los Angeles County ballot processing facility in Industry, California, on November 9, 2022.Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesCNN
—The $122 million-dollar Los Angeles mayor’s race between US Rep. Karen Bass and real estate magnate Rick Caruso is still too close to call, along with six House races in California that could determine the balance of power in Washington, raising a perennial question: Why does it take California so long to count its votes?More than a week after Election Day and as the nation awaits an official call on which party will control the US House of Representatives, attention is turning to some of the outstanding races in California that could tip the scales. Tuesday was the last day that county election officials could accept ballots that were postmarked on or before Election Day – meaning the Golden State is just getting started counting some of those late-arriving ballots.California now mails every registered voter a ballot, a practice that began in 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic and ultimately became permanent in September 2021 in an effort to increase voter access and participation. Under state law, ballots postmarked on or before Election Day must be accepted by county elections offices for seven days after polls close.The sheer volume of ballots that election officials are now counting is enormous. In the 2020 election, more than 15 million mail ballots were cast in the general election – comprising about 87% of the total. This year, there were nearly 22 million registered California voters by mid-October, according to figures from the California secretary of state.The official canvassing period – the process of tabulating votes – will continue up to December 8, when county election officials must report their final official results to the secretary of state (though some counties have set earlier deadlines to certify their own election results). The California secretary of state will certify the state’s results by December 16.“It’s just a huge electorate and in some of the counties – LA County, Orange County, even Kern County where the [GOP Rep. David] Valadao race is – there are a lot of people living there and a lot of ballots that have to be counted,” said Christian Grose, academic director at the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, who has studied election administration. “With that ‘week after’ deadline, really the counting starts in earnest now. They really will be finishing the counting in the next week or two instead of the immediate day after Election Day.”The resources available to count ballots also vary widely by jurisdiction. In Kern County, where Valdao is defending his seat in a close contest with Democratic state Assemblyman Rudy Salas, Grose noted, “They only have one ballot counting machine. That’s a funding and resource choice. They should probably have more than one ballot counting machine.”The counting took so long in Valadao’s 2018 race against Democrat TJ Cox that it was the last uncalled House race in the country. Cox narrowly unseated Valadao that year before the Republican won a rematch in 2020. (This cycle, Kern County Clerk Mary Bedard told KGET in Bakersfield that it could take weeks to count the remaining 70,000 ballots in that county, in part because the county has just one sorter machine).The processing of each mail ballot in California is labor intensive, in part because there are many safeguards built into the process. Once county election officials receive the ballots, they must confirm that the voter has not already voted, verify their signature on the ballot envelope, remove the ballot from the return envelope, then tally the votes. There are also additional tranches of ballots that take even more time to process, including provisional ballots, ballots from voters who took advantage of same-day voter registration and damaged ballots that couldn’t be read by machines.As of Tuesday evening, there were more than 2.8 million ballots remaining to be counted statewide, according to the secretary of state’s latest unprocessed ballots report. The secretary of state’s office did not respond to a request for an interview this week about the speed of the process. But California Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber released a statement on Tuesday night stating that it could take days or weeks to know the final results of a number of close contests.“We have a huge population of registered voters and California stresses enfranchisement, so we have a process that by law ensures both voting rights and the integrity of elections,” Weber said in a statement. “I would call on all everyone to be patient.”In Los Angeles County, there were about 565,000 outstanding ballots as of Tuesday. The Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk does not provide information about how many ballots remain by jurisdiction, leaving the mayoral campaigns in the dark about how many of those ballots will determine the city mayoral election or even which parts of the city they are from. (There are 88 cities in LA County and a spokesman for the Los Angeles County registrar’s office noted that if they were to take the extra step of organizing ballots by jurisdiction, that could prolong the tallying process).In the contest to replace term-limited Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Bass has been leading Caruso – who spent more than $100 million in the race, much of it his own money, compared with about $9 million spent by the Democratic congresswoman. Her lead has grown in recent days as more ballots have been tallied. But both campaigns said they remain optimistic about their chances of victory.When asked about the lengthy processing times for counting ballots in Los Angeles County, Mike Sanchez, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County registrar, said the priority is to ensure that all eligible ballots cast by Election Day and returned through the postal service (or left in person at a ballot drop box or vote center) “are processed, verified, and counted – and this takes time.”“In California, counties have 30 days to process these ballots – which in Los Angeles County can be hundreds of thousands – and to certify election results,” he said. “This 30-day period and its activities and timelines are consistent to past election cycles, including the 2020 presidential election.”California’s nonpartisan redistricting process also created more competitive districts than in many other states, resulting in tight races – particularly in Orange County, a former Republican bastion-turned-battleground where President Joe Biden made a final campaign swing to help Democratic Rep. Katie Porter. CNN still has not projected a winner in Porter’s race or six other House contests in California (including one between two Democrats), as well as several other House races in Alaska, Colorado, Maine and Oregon."
2269,iaf honour tendulkar,IAF honour for Tendulkar,"New Delhi: Star cricketer Sachin Tendulkar on Wednesday became the first sportsperson — also the only eminent personality without any aviation background — to be selected for an Indian Air Force honour after the IAF announced an honorary rank of Group Captain for him.Elated with the honour, Tendulkar said, “It is indeed a great honour that I have been considered for honorary Group Captain in the IAF. As an Indian I am proud to be associated with the dynamic force and I shall do my very best to be brand ambassador for the force.""The IAF said in a statement that under the provision of grant of honorary rank by Armed Forces to eminent personalities acknowledging their contribution towards the nation, “the President and the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces of India is pleased to confer Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar the honorary rank of Group Captain of the Indian Air Force.""“In recognition of Sachin’s glorious achievements as a cricketer and sports icon par excellence, IAF had mooted a proposal to confer the honorary rank of Group Captain.“Besides the recognition, his association with the IAF will motivate the younger generation to join the Air Force to serve the country,"" the statement added.Reacting to it, Tendulkar said modalities for the event were being worked out.“I’m looking forward to familiarising myself with the IAF and I once again salute IAF for the great honour bestowed on me,"" he said in a statement from London.In 2008, India’s World Cup winning captain Kapil Dev had received the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel of the Territorial Army.Till now 21 eminent persons have been granted honorary ranks by the IAF. The first person was Raja of Jawhar, Raja Yashwant Rao who was conferred Flight Lieutenant rank in 1944.JRD Tata was made an honorary Air Vice Marshal in 1974 and the last one to get such an honour was another industrialist-cum-aviator Vijaypat Singhania who was made an honorary Air Commodore in 1990.Tendulkar is the first sportsperson to be conferred this honour, also the first person with no aviation background.Tendulkar is arguably the best batsman in the history of cricket, having amassed some 31,000-plus runs in Test and ODI cricket with 93 international centuries under his belt.The 37-year-old is not only the highest run-getter in both Test and ODI versions of the game but also the only player to have scored a double century in the 50-over format.One of India’s most decorated sportspersons, Tendulkar has won the country’s highest sports honour — the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna — and the Padma Vibhushan award."
3946,fiji dogged strays,Fiji dogged by strays after Covid breeding boom,"Amid the iconic sounds of Fiji – the rolling of the ocean, a church choir – is an unexpected and unwelcome noise: the insistent barking of stray dogs.The population of stray dogs across the Pacific country has exploded in the last few years, sparked by a dog baby boom, which occurred as neutering initiatives stopped during the pandemic and border closures halted the flow of essential international volunteer vets.A territorial pack of dogs sit guard on a house porch in Ba.“It’s a huge problem … there are so many dogs,” says Shaneel Narayan, manager of Suva’s SPCA shelter. Naryan estimates that in the capital, Suva, alone, there are between 20,000 and 30,000 dogs on the loose. Some are stray while others are roaming – owned by people but allowed to freely roam the streets.“In a year we used to desex about 3,000 animals and because of Covid for two years, we couldn’t do any of these programmes because of the restrictions,” says Narayan. “[The dogs] have five or six puppies in one litter. So in two years you can imagine how many animals we’re looking at in a neighbourhood.”A SPCA worker stirs a mixture of egg and rice in preparation for the dogs lunch.The dogs themselves are largely left to scavenge for scraps, nurse injuries from abandonment and raise litters in the city outskirts.Abandoned puppies available for adoption at SPCA in Suva.Even as neutering services have resumed post-pandemic, SPCA and other animal shelters are struggling to cope with the number of animals.“Post-Covid it has gone really bad, intake per week we’re looking at around 40 to 50 animals coming into the shelter,” he says. “We are pretty much overwhelmed.”Stray dogs carry diseases, frequent busy roads and some have even made headlines for vicious attacks on children.A group of stray dogs watch on at passing traffic.Petero Bole, security guard at the University of the South Pacific, has to remove dogs from the campus. “We have to chase them out,” he says.“At night-time dogs roam the campus. Suva city council sets traps for them, we get maybe two to three dogs in the morning.”On the other side of Fiji’s largest island, Viti Levu, the situation is just as dire, especially at the Greater Good Foundation (GGF) in Lautoka, which houses more than 200 dogs in an open sanctuary.The sanctuary is a jigsaw of fenced pens, each home to dozens of barking and nipping dogs. Mere Ranedi, who cares for the dogs, knows each animal by name. One of the biggest challenges is keeping them fed. “Every day we go through 47 kilograms of rice and 52 kilograms of dal.”“It won’t work overnight; it takes at least eight to 20 years. It has worked in certain parts of Sri Lanka and the Philippines,” says Narayan.The dog problem in Fiji has no winners – the animals are subject to abuse, carry disease, bite people, and run across busy roads. Vets are overwhelmed and the community is frustrated with the impact of the animals.A stray dog roams the student cafeteria at the University of the South Pacific in Laucala Bay, Suva Photograph: Cooper Williams/The GuardianThe situation could still get worse, with sanctuaries like the GGF struggling to care for the animals. In July the sanctuary warned that its funds were critically low, leaving it weeks away from closing. It managed to secure enough donations to stay open, but does not have any government funding or corporate partners.“If we are forced to close, the dogs in our care … would have nowhere to go,” said the charity in a statement in July. As well as reducing the risk to the community, Ranedi says, their sanctuary is the safest place for the dogs. “These dogs are so fortunate to be rescued and brought here.”"

4744,features gen cpus,Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero review: High-end features for next-gen CPUs,"Both gamers and content creators will find a lot to like in the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero. It’s well designed and has all of the next-gen features both parties need, such as PCIe Gen 5, Thunderbolt 4 and USB ports, and plenty of M.2 slots. It lacks 10GbE networking, which you would expect with a premium board like this, but that’s far from a deal breaker. Overall this is a fantastic next-gen motherboard with a relatively affordable price tag that will appeal to a wide audience.There are many clever ways to riff on this motherboard’s name, but we’ll spare you the puns and metaphors and dive right in to see if this is the “Hero” motherboard that we’ve been looking for. (Okay, we couldn’t resist.)Perhaps the best candidates to match this heroic offering from Asus are in the form of Intel’s new 13th-generation CPU lineup, such as the i9 13900K. This chip is bursting with fiery performance and power-draw that are superhero-caliber!The Asus ROG Maximus Hero is up to the task of meeting the i9 13900K where it’s at. This Z790 iteration of the illustrious “Republic of Gamers” (ROG) lineup aspires to be the perfect blend of function and aesthetics.If the Asus ROG Strix Z790-E is ideal for gamers, the Z790 Hero takes it up a notch—both gamers and content creators will be spoiled by the bevy of extras. We’ll go over the specs, features, design, and performance. Will the extra feature set entice you to choose this board over other options? Let’s find out!The Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero clocks in at an MSRP of $629, which puts it near the mid to upper echelon of motherboards. (Still shy of the more expensive behemoths such as the Asus ROG Extreme we reviewed for Z690)Let’s take a gander at the basic specs below, and what you’re getting for the price. We’ll subsequently discuss the most consequential.You’ll be able to use both Intel’s 12th- and 13th-gen CPUs with Z790, along with your existing CPU coolers.The box is bigger than most standard motherboards, including a few neat included extras that denote the Z790 Hero’s premium pedigree. Of note is the Asus M.2 Hyper PCIe card, allowing you to add two additional M.2 drives, one being capable of PCIe Gen 5. Other included accessories range from the driver USB drive and ROG stickers, to extra cooling hardware for adding small fans.The Hero adds a host of features that go beyond purely gaming necessities and appeal to content creators, too.The Z790 Hero, much like the ROG Strix, has everything you’d ever want for a sweet gaming build. Where the Hero really starts to shine is in its extra features, which round it out for content creators too.Z790 continues the next-gen upgrades introduced with Z690, such as DDR5 and PCIe Gen 5. While current GPUs such as the RTX 4090 are still only PCIe Gen 4, you’ll have tons of future-proofing here.On the Hero, you’ll get two PCIe 16x PCIe slots, which both offer the awesome Q-Release button. If you’ve ever tried to remove your GPU out of a tight PC build, you’ll know how valuable these quick-release buttons are allowing for easier access!The Q-Release button on the right side of the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero allows for quick GPU removal.Thiago TrevisanUSB ports are plenty here, and you’ll get one that’s the newer 20Gb/s 3.2 Gen 2×2 too. Of interest to workstation users and content creators is the inclusion of two Thunderbolt 4 ports, with speeds up to 40Gb/s. Thunderbolt has a large ecosystem of supported accessories, from speedy external drives to even external GPUs, something content creators can appreciate.The included ROG Hyper M.2 Card.Thiago TrevisanM.2 options are interesting here: three onboard PCIe Gen 4 slots supplemented by the PCIe Asus Hyper M.2 card for two additional slots. Some motherboards will provide more slots onboard, but at the expense of PCIe lane compromises. At least here you have the option to add them with some easier access. Of benefit to the onboard slots, is the Q-Latch system, making toolless installation possible. This is a great innovation since those tiny M.2 screws are often difficult to work with!You’ll still get six SATA ports for those who need it, which exceeds the four SATA ports found on lower-tier motherboards recently.Audio connectivity is nicely represented, with the ROG SupremeFX ALC4082 Codec and audio outputs on the back, including digital.Networking options are fine, with Intel’s 2.5GbE and 6E Wi-Fi. We’d like to see 10GbE offered on this level of motherboard, like what is available on the Asus ROG Extreme, however.The useful overclocking features are here too, of course. A handy start button on the motherboard itself comes in clutch when you’re on a test bench, or simply testing your new PC build. Clear CMOS and BIOS Flashback are also present—staples of premium overclocking motherboards.The Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero has an eye-catching design.Thiago TrevisanThe $629 MSRP ROG Maximus Z790 Hero feels solidly built, and substantial in the hands. Part of that is thanks to the impressively robust backplate—with a tastefully done Asus ROG logo. This accentuates the premium feel of the Z790 Hero in both visual and tactile quality.The Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero’s backplate.Thiago TrevisanThe impressive design continues on the front with just the right amount of RGB touches to make it appealing. You’ll get a beautiful display on the I/O upper-left area of the motherboard, customizable in the Asus Armoury Crate software. Asus calls this “Polymo Lighting.” We like to call it “cool shiny lights,” since it’s a colorful display of eye candy!Eye-popping RGB included.Thiago TrevisanThe M.2 and PCIe area has functional and attractive styling, with the Asus ROG logo once again prominent. Reflective surfaces abound, although when in use, they’re often hidden by the GPU and bright RGB effects.Rounding out the rest of the design, you’ll have the imposing VRM heatsink letting you know this motherboard is ready for action! Careful with those fingers; this is high grade stuff!Thiago TrevisanAsus calls the 20+1 power stages its “Teamed Power Stage Design” because of the use of “Phase Doublers.” This ensures maximum performance while keeping voltages and thermals in check. Strapping Intel’s i9 13900K to this, even overclocked? No worries, these VRMs will easily handle the scorching monster without breaking a sweat!While the Z690 Hero also has the chops to handle the latest CPUs, the Z790 has a few added performance benefits. When it comes to DDR5, Z790 has improved stability and higher overlocking limits for the fastest RAM kits. Asus says it’s due to improved signal routing—so you’re welcome, overclockers. Go have fun! (Non-overclockers will also benefit from added stability and better compatibility with 4 -DIMM RAM configurations on the Z790, too).The Asus BIOS has been renowned for ease of use and support for deep tinkering for those who want it. Sure, easy automatic XMP profiles and Ai overclocking are here, too. If you want to change RAM timings, or adjust minute details on a CPU overclock, you’ll be like a kid in a toy store here.Thiago TrevisanIf you prefer to keep your mad-scientist role-playing out of the BIOS, Asus Armoury Crate software is here for that. Easily adjust fan curves, and Aura Sync RGB options aplenty. It can automatically check for driver updates, although we always recommended occasional checking of the Asus website—sometimes BIOS updates and the like are released faster there if you need to update. Otherwise, the software has great visual appeal and is generally easy to use.The Asus ROG Maximus Z90 Hero is a delightful motherboard that bridges the gap between gamers and content creators. For gamers wanting premium build quality, chock-full of options, you can’t go wrong. It’s going to look great in your build with its tasteful RGB, too. At $629, it’s more expensive than previous-generation Hero offerings, but it’s also packing the latest and greatest technologies, which aren’t cheap to implement.For content creators and those wanting to use the board as a workstation, there’s a lot to like here, too. Thunderbolt 4, plenty of USB, and five slots for M.2 drives with the included Asus Hyper PCIe card, for example. Six SATA ports will give you even more storage options, too. If you don’t need 10GbE networking, there is little else that you will need.If you want a high-end, premium-feeling motherboard, without having to shell out the dough for the uber-class options, the Z790 Hero makes for an excellent choice with little compromise."

But the small float and low delivery volumes is an alert against wagering on it for some who fear it may have risen beyond its fundamentals when many other newly-listed companies are trading below their sale price.""The valuations seem to be a bit out of whack."" Lovable that sold shares at Rs 205 apiece, has risen 109% to Rs 428.5 on Friday after touching a high of Rs 462.50. Some of the top shareholders include HDFC Mutual Fund, SBI Funds, UTI Asset management and Fidelity, filings show.Total outstanding shares of the firm is at 1.68 crore and public holding is about 50 lakh shares. The Sensex was down 2.6% during the period and the BSE IPO index was up 1.6%. Fineotex Chemical and C Mahendra Exports are the two companies that have returned more than Lovable, among this years' IPOs.The stock trades at 31 times forecast earnings for fiscal 2012, compared with Page Industries' 27 times its earnings. Although the stock had been among the top traded in the last few days, gaining to limit on some days, the number of shares that changed had remained negligible. The quantity of shares actually changing hands — was in single digit for many days.The delivery ratio was 2% to 9% between June 10 and 17 when the stock moved up 33% on BSE, exchange data show. This follows the performance of Page Industries which has gained 396% since its IPO in March 2007. Shares that were sold at Rs 396 apiece are trading at Rs 1,784. ""Rising disposable incomes and growing awareness about personal hygiene are boosting growth of the innerwear market in India,"" said Anand Rathi Secutities in a recent report.""Also enhancing this growth is the rising modern trade malls, shopping complexes etc,"" said the brokerage which has a target price of Rs 430.The Mumbai-based company's Rs 93-crore IPO drew good response with it getting subscribed 21.8 times the institutional portion, 98.5 times among wealthy individuals and 20.5 times in the retail category. Rise in raw material prices and intensifying competition are the two risks for earnings growth, the report said."

We have and will continue to learn hard lessons from this.Awaab Ishaak on his second - and last - birthday (Image: PA)“We didn’t recognise the level of risk to a little boy’s health from the mould in the family’s home. We allowed a legal disrepair process, widely used in the housing sector, to get in the way of promptly tackling the mould.”He added: “We must make sure this can never happen again. Awaab’s death needs to be a wake-up call for everyone in housing, social care and health.“We will take responsibility for sharing what we have learnt about the impact to health of damp, condensation and mould with the social housing sector and beyond.“We support the Coroner and Housing Ombudsman’s call for the government’s Decent Homes Standard to be strengthened to include damp and mould, and the Coroner’s decision to write to the Ministers of Housing and Health on this.”Labour MP for Rotherham Sarah Champion (Image: PA)Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme today, housing ombudsman Richard Blakeway said: ""This is an appalling, heart-breaking case but, sadly, the kind of failures that we saw here, whilst they may not have as tragic a consequence, they often happen and they often cause deep distress, profound distress to residents.""He said landlords needed a clear, urgent and proactive approach to dealing with issues.He added: ""I think one of the issues that we've seen here is that landlords have not always prioritised or focused on issues like damp and mould and there's kind of been almost a dismissive attitude by some, a kind of fatalism by some. You can see now the consequences of it."

280,fetus seven weeks,Former Ms South Carolina reveals she was forced to carry unviable fetus for seven weeks,"A former Ms South Carolina was forced to carry an unviable fetus for seven weeks when her state outlawed abortions following the overturning of Roe v Wade.Jill Hartle, 35, said it felt like a ‘dagger to the heart’ every time strangers would approach her and say she ‘looked amazing’ and asking when the baby was due.At an 18-week scan in August doctors warned her unborn baby — Ivy Grace — had the incurable heart condition Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS).Most baby’s born with the condition die within days and are in terrible pain, meaning they need to be heavily sedated.At the time South Carolina had just introduced a six-week abortion ban which forbid abortions except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the mother.The 2013 Ms Carolina contestant had to fly 500 miles to Washington D.C. while pregnant to get the termination at week 25.She said she spent seven weeks in 'excruciating pain' physically and emotionally while she carried the fetus in the lead up to the abortion date.Ms Hartle said: 'Every time I felt her move was like a dagger to the heart.'And the mental toll — I was grieving the loss of my child while still carrying her and also waiting to be taken care of so that I could start the healing process.'She has revealed her story to put pressure on the state — with one of the harshest abortion limits in the country — to ease its laws.HLHS is normally diagnosed at about week 18 to 20 in pregnancy. It cannot be detected earlier because the heart has not properly developed.Jill Hartle, 35, who lives in Charleston, said it was the 'most excruciating' period of her life the seven week wait until she could get an abortion. She is pictured in 2013 after winning the Ms South Carolina competitionHer baby — Ivy Grace — had no issues in early scans (pictured above early in the pregnancy). But by week 18 doctors became concerned about her heart, and eventually diagnosed her with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS). Most babies don't survive with this beyond four days after being bornBecause South Carolina bans abortion from six weeks, Ms Hartle had to travel 500 miles to Washington DC to get the procedure. She flew to the city. Ms Hartle is shown above with husband Matt and baby Ivy Grace after the pregnancy was terminatedWith tears in her eyes, Ms Hartle said while she was waiting for termination she had many women coming up to her saying she looks great and asking when the baby was dueMs Hartle was thrilled to find out she was pregnant in April this year — about a year after tying the knot with Matt, and was given a due date of this December.In a video showing the moment she got the result, the hairdresser is seen jumping for joy clutching the positive test and clasping her mouth with her hands.Scans at eight weeks and again at 12 weeks suggested the infant was developing normally and there were no problems.This is where the left side of the heart does not form properly, leading to the left ventricle — one of four heart chambers — being too small.Normally, the right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs while the left sends it to the body. In HLHS, however, oxygen-rich blood struggles to get to the rest of the body.About 60 to 80 per cent of fetuses diagnosed with HLHS are terminated due to the risks and low quality of life.Talking about the diagnosis in a video, Ms Hartle said: 'My stomach sank because I knew how bad that could be and I knew what it meant.'The doctor said: ""Her heart is not what we want it to look like"". I said: 'My best friend had a child with HLHS."" And she said: ""That's what we're looking at.""Ms Hartle decided to terminate the pregnancy with husband Matt, but had to travel out of state due to South Carolina's restrictive abortion laws.Eventually they found a clinic in Washington D.C., but because many women were in a similar position there was a two-week delay.Ms Hartle had to spend this period feeling her fetus kick while also grieving for the lost youngster.She said: 'That was probably the most excruciating two weeks ever.'Every two hours I had a women coming into my chair, saying: ""Oh my God you look incredible. Are you so excited? Have you picked a day care? Tell me everything!""'[But] I knew I had to give her back to God, and then to find out your state cannot take care of you alienates you even more.'Ms Hartle said it was 'excruciatingly painful' needing to travel the 531-miles from her home to Washington DC by air, a one hour flight, and then having to figure out where to stay, how to get food, all while preparing for an abortion.The pregnancy was terminated at 25 weeks, with Washington DC allowing abortion to be legal at all stages of pregnancy.Explaining her decision to get an abortion, Ms Hartle said: 'We decided that the best thing for our particular case and our particular daughter, Ivy Grace, was to just give her the most peaceful possible way to heaven and to be healed and to be free and never feel a moment's pain.'I knew I had to give her back to God. I know in my heart that I am doing the most selfless thing possible.'I knew she would never feel one ounce of misery, one ounce of pain.'[The abortion] was the hardest day I have ever experienced in my whole life, but it was also the most peaceful day in my whole life. I knew I was giving her the gift of peace.'She is revealing her story, to support other women and put pressure on South Carolina's authorities to row back on their abortion restrictions.The state banned abortions after week six of pregnancy in July. If she had remained in the state she would have been forced to carry the baby to term.The six-week ban is currently being challenged in the state's Supreme Court, with campaigners arguing it contravenes the rights of people to make choices about their medical care and bodily integrity.About one in 3,000 infants born in the US have HLHS.HLHS is when the left ventricle (right) does not form properly, leaving the heart unable to pump blood around the body properly. It takes at least three operations within the first two years of life to fix, with most babies not able to surviveMs Hartle was thrilled when she found out she was pregnant, and is pictured left with the pregnancy test and right with husband Matt after finding outMs Hartle is shown above holding scans of her fetus, who was terminated due to an incurable heart defectBut it cannot be diagnosed until at least 16 weeks, although it is more common for it to be detected at 18 to 20 weeks. The delay is due to the small size of the heart making it difficult to see on scanners.Dr Natalie Gregory, an obstetrician in Mount Pleasant who treated Ms Hartle, said people think abortions are happening later in pregnancy because of the irresponsibility of the mother.'When in fact many times these women are remaining pregnant to find out what's going on with their baby.'We have to wait until they grow and develop so we can see what's going on with their baby.'Ms Hartle's friend Lacey whose first pregnancy was also with HLHS said her heart was 'shot in a million pieces' when she heard the diagnosis.In her case — from before Roe v Wade was overturned, she also decided to terminate the fetus.She has since had two healthy children, which she says would not have been possible if they had continued with the first pregnancy.Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usualWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

More infoIt comes as the cost-of-living crisis causes anxiety for almost three in five (58 percent) in the lead up to December, with 44 percent finding the festive season the most stressful time of the year.But 30 percent are not planning to ask to share the cost of the celebrations with family and friends this Christmas season.Top reasons for this include fears of dampening the festive mood (20 percent), not knowing how to approach the conversation (18 percent), and embarrassment or shame (17 percent), according to the research, commissioned by PayPal.Others feel guilty, or worry about family conflict over finances – although 22 percent would be more likely to ask for help if they felt everybody was doing it.It also emerged that of the parents polled, almost a third (30 percent) would never dream of asking their offspring to help fund the festivities.However, 55 percent of Gen Z respondents would offer to chip in for the festivities for their parents and grandparents, as they feel they would be too proud to ask.Those in London are the most willing to ask for help splitting the costs for food and gifts this festive season, while those in the North East would be the least willing.But despite 43 percent wanting to make grand plans for the festive season, 30 percent will be making cutbacks this year to help with keeping on top of their festive finances.This includes not buying unnecessary presents (51 percent), having an agreed spending cap with friends and family (34 percent), reducing travel plans (33 percent), and not attending Christmas parties (27 percent).Other cost-cutting plans include “bring your own bottle” celebrations, each person bringing a dish for Christmas dinner, and entertaining fewer guests.And more than a fifth (22 percent) will be making their own gifts, in a bid to save on festive spending.Despite this, 44 percent will not compromise on making Christmas perfect for their loved ones – even if it means making sacrifices themselves.When it comes to splitting costs, 18 percent don’t know the easiest way to do this, but four in ten (41 percent) use online banking apps or digital payment services.In addition, 44 percent would be open to hearing about new digital ways to split costs as they navigate the current financial landscape, according to the research by OnePoll.Vincent Belloc, managing director for PayPal UK, said: “The ongoing cost-of-living crisis can dampen the festive spirit as people are worried about their finances.“Money management and splitting costs with family and friends is a difficult conversation."
3616,higher costs trigger,Higher costs trigger rise in insolvencies,"The number of corporate insolvencies increased by 38 per cent year-on-year from 1,410 to 1,948, according to figures from the Insolvency Service. The numbers were driven by 1,594 so-called creditors’ voluntary liquidations.Compulsory liquidations rose by 357 per cent annually to 242. The service said that this was partly due to HMRC issuing more demands for repayment from companies.The tax authority was barred from issuing winding-up petitions during the pandemic as businesses were forced to shut down by the government. However, these restrictions were removed on April 1 this year, leading to an increase in activity against companies.David Hudson, restructuring partner at FRP Advisory, said: “Inflation is devastating margins and throwing into doubt historically sound business models, which is eating away at confidence, undermining recovery plans and, crucially, testing the resolve of lenders.”Joules, the fashion retailer, became the latest casualty on the high street this week as it called in administrators at Interpath Advisory.It had sought a bridging loan as it feared defaulting on a Barclays facility due at the end of the month, and it had approached strategic investors about a possible capital raise.But Tom Joule, its founder, warned yesterday that the business had become too complex to pursue the cost savings required to secure the company’s future.Nicky Fisher, vice-president of R3, the restructuring trade body, said: “The jury is still out on whether the Christmas trading period, which will include an unseasonal football World Cup, will lead to the traditional boom many businesses are hoping for, or whether disappointing sales over the festive period will lead to businesses turning to an insolvency process to resolve their financial issues.”"
4199,canada sanctions iranian,Canada sanctions Iranian drone makers amid Russian strikes in Ukraine - National,"Ottawa sanctioned two Iranian drone manufacturers on Wednesday for reportedly supplying lethal drones to Russia in its war against Ukraine.Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly also announced sanctions on six individuals, including senior Iranian officials and prominent government supporters, over “gross and systematic human rights violations” inside and outside the nation. It is the fifth package of sanctions Canada has implemented against Iran this year.“Canada is committed to standing by the people of Iran as they courageously fight for their human rights. Day by day, the situation in Iran worsens as the Iranian regime continues its crackdowns in defiance of appeals from its citizens and the international community,” Joly said in a news release.“Canada will not hesitate to use all diplomatic tools at its disposal to respond to the Iranian regime’s aggressions, whether in Iran or abroad.”Wednesday’s measures effectively freeze any assets the entities or individuals may hold in Canada. Individuals listed are also rendered inadmissible to Canada under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.The drone manufacturers sanctioned were Shahed Aviation Industries and Qods Aviation Industries, the government said. Shahed is the maker of the Shahed-136 combat drone, which has been used by Russia in Ukrainian bombing campaigns.Meanwhile, Qods designs and produces combat drones “used by the regime’s armed forces and designated terrorist organizations aligned with the regime, such as Hezbollah, to carry out destabilizing regional operations,” the government said.“This firm is also involved in the development of lethal UAVs exported to Russia for use in Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.”After denying reports it was supplying Russia with lethal drones, Iran acknowledged for the first time on Nov. 5 it had sent Moscow drones before the Feb. 24 war began. It denied continuing to supply drones to Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Iran of lying, saying Kyiv’s forces were destroying at least 10 of its drones every day.In recent weeks, Iran has been engaged in a brutal crackdown on protesters amid nationwide protests, which first erupted over the Sept. 16 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country’s so-called morality police. She was detained for allegedly violating Iran’s strict dress code for women.1:56Iran schoolchildren reportedly killed for protestingAlthough the protests first focused on Iran’s mandatory headscarf, or hijab, they have since transformed into one of the greatest challenges to the ruling clerics since the chaotic years following the 1979 Islamic Revolution.Story continues below advertisementIranian authorities announced late last month that they will hold public trials for 1,000 people over the protests that have convulsed the country.On Monday, the federal government designated Iran as a regime that has engaged in “terrorism” as well as the systematic and gross violation of human rights.As a result, Iran’s head of state, members of its cabinet, its ambassadors and its senior diplomats are just some of the thousands of Iranians now permanently banned from entering Canada as a direct result of this designation.Senior members of the judiciary, military, intelligence agencies and public servants are also all barred from the country — and any of the banned who are already in Canada, the government said in a news release, “may be investigated and removed.”The sanctions are intended to signal support for women’s rights, Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said on Monday, and to “fight for justice” on behalf of the families who lost loved ones on flight PS752, which was shot down in Tehran just over a thousand days ago."

About 25% — or more than 10 million people — were in delinquency or default, and the rest had applied for temporary relief for struggling borrowers, including deferments or forbearances.Federal student loan payments have been on pause since March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic first hit the U.S. and crippled the economy. Resuming the bills for over 40 million Americans will be a massive task, and the Biden administration had hoped to ease the transition by forgiving a large share of student debt first.""[T]he one-time student loan debt relief program was intended to avoid"" that problem, he added.The borrowers most in jeopardy of defaulting are those for whom Biden's student loan forgiveness plan would have wiped out their balance entirely, Kvaal said.

676,heroin addict dad,I’m A Celeb’s Seann Walsh talks growing up with a heroin-addict dad,"’m A Celebrity’s Seann Walsh says growing up with a heroin-addict dad had a huge effect on him and believes it is why he has always struggled to have structure in his life.The 36-year-old comedian says he has attempted to address his issues over the years, including through therapy sessions after he found himself caught up in the middle of a kissing scandal when taking part in Strictly Come Dancing in 2018.Walsh’s career was left in tatters after he was pictured kissing professional dancer Katya Jones, 33, despite having a girlfriend at the time, Rebecca Humphries, and Jones was married to fellow pro-dancer Neil Jones, 40.Since then, he has ditched alcohol, worked on turning his life around, and is now preparing to become a dad for the first time after announcing in October that his girlfriend of three years, Grace Adderley, is pregnant.According to the Mirror, he said: “This idea of structure in my life, this was one of the things I had to grapple with, after the Strictly stuff, you kind of realise that life couldn’t continue the way it was. Something had to give.Seann Walsh found himself caught up in a scandal after being pictured kissing his Strictly professional dance partner Katya Jones in 2018/ BBC“The booze had to go and I had to try to rebuild my life and I went to therapy and therapy was about trying to find order and structure and all this stuff. That can be eye-rolling at times, if you’re talking about it and listening to it.“But that thing of finding structure you realise, of course, that came from having a dad who was a heroin addict. If your dad’s a heroin addict, you’re not going to be someone who wakes up in the morning and does a to-do list. That organisation isn’t going to be there.”Walsh was a surprise addition to this year’s series of I’m A Celebrity alongside former UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.He has said that he hopes his appearance on the show will help to “draw a line” under his past so that he can finally move forward."
5186,throwing big event,Things to Consider When Throwing a Big Event,"Your big event is fast approaching. And amid all of the excitement of how it’s going to go, there is also some crippling uncertainty as to how you are going to pull it off successfully. Fear not, as here are some key things to consider when throwing a big event so you can ensure you have taken every aspect of the event into account.This aspect of many events is often under-looked and not thought of enough. But if you’re going to have a ton of people at an event, you’re going to need to make sure you have enough bathrooms for people to use. If your event space does not seem adequately stocked with restrooms, or maybe there is an issue in terms of the majority of the restrooms being too far of a walk away from the event space, consider bringing in a service like bathroom rentals for concerts. Bathrooms are one thing you simply cannot afford to not have enough of at a big event, so make sure you consider thoroughly whether they will be in an adequate supply well before your event is almost here.Also of importance at your big event is the food and drink that you’ll be serving to your guests. When you have guests attend your event, you want to make sure they are happy and not thinking about something like not having enough food that could potentially ruin their opinions of the event. Get an estimate of how many people will be attending your event well before the week of the event so you are able to let the caterer or food service provider have more than enough time to figure out how much food and drink is best to serve. This is one aspect of an event that you cannot afford to not provide enough of.When you have a lot of people in an event space, you’ll want to make sure that those who want to sit or have a surface to eat on will be able to do so. Taking stock of how many tables and chairs you need is also something you’ll want to do well before the event starts so it is out of your mind and not a worry on the day of the event.Bathrooms, food and drink and tables and chairs are all aspects of a big event that you’re going to want to sure up weeks before an event begins. If you do, you’ll be on a path to a successful event."

We were born from a desire to fundamentally change how dating apps work in our culture today,' it explains.'We saw a world where many users were burnt out by the speed of most dating apps. They were spending hours on their phones and had little to show for it.'People were so busy matching that they weren’t actually connecting, in person, where it counts.'That’s why we built an app that’s designed to be deleted: purpose-built to get people off their phones and out on dates.'The first ever incarnation of a dating app can be traced back to 1995 when Match.com was first launched.The website allowed single people to upload a profile, a picture and chat to people online.The app was intended to allow people looking for long-term relationships to meet.eHarmony was developed in 2000 and two years later Ashley Madison, a site dedicated to infidelity and cheating, was first launched.A plethora of other dating sites with a unique target demographic were set up in the next 10-15 years including: OKCupid (2004), Plenty of Fish (2006), Grindr (2009) and Happn (2013).In 2012, Tinder was launched and was the first 'swipe' based dating platform.After its initial launch it's usage snowballed and by March 2014 there were one billion matches a day, worldwide.In 2014, co-founder of Tinder, Whitney Wolfe Herd launched Bumble, a dating app that empowered women by only allowing females to send the first message.The popularity of mobile dating apps such as Tinder, Badoo and more recently Bumble is attributable to a growing amount of younger users with a busy schedule.In the 1990s, there was a stigma attached to online dating as it was considered a last-ditch and desperate attempt to find love.This belief has dissipated and now around one third of marriages are between couples who met online.A survey from 2014 found that 84 per cent of dating app users were using online dating services to look for a romantic relationship.Twenty-four per cent stated that that they used online dating apps explicitly for sexual encounters."

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)ASSOCIATED PRESSKEN MORITSUGUNovember 16, 2022, 10:33 AM·2 min readBEIJING (AP) — Chinese authorities locked down a major university in Beijing on Wednesday after finding one COVID-19 case as they stick to a “zero-COVID” approach despite growing public discontent.Peking University students and faculty were not allowed to leave the grounds unless necessary and classes on the main campus — where the case was found — were moved online through Friday, a university notice said. Still, some people could be seen entering and leaving the main campus Wednesday in the Chinese capital’s Haidian district.Beijing reported more than 350 new cases in the latest 24-hour period, a small fraction of its 21-million population but enough to trigger localized lockdowns and quarantines under China's “zero-COVID” strategy. Nationwide, China reported about 20,000 cases, up from about 8,000 a week ago.Authorities are steering away from citywide lockdowns to try to minimize the impact on freedom of movement and a sagging economy. They want to avoid a repeat of the Shanghai lockdown earlier this year that paralyzed shipping and prompted neighborhood protests. Revised national guidelines issued last week called on local governments to follow a targeted and scientific approach that avoids unnecessary measures.Peking University has more than 40,000 students on multiple campuses, most in Beijing. It was unclear how many were affected by the lockdown. The 124-year-old institution is one of China's top universities and was a center of student protest in earlier decades. Its graduates include leading intellectuals, writers, politicians and businesspeople.Lockdowns elsewhere have sparked scattered protests. Earlier this week, videos posted online showed crowds pulling down barriers in the southern city of Guangzhou in a densely built area that is home to migrant workers in the clothing industry.Guangzhou, an industrial export hub near Hong Kong, reported more than 6,000 new cases in what is the nation's largest ongoing outbreak. The pandemic led the Badminton World Federation to move next month's HSBC World Tour Finals from Guangzhou to Bangkok, the federation announced this week.Other cities with major outbreaks include Chongqing in the southwest, Zhengzhou in Henan province and Hohhot, the capital of the Inner Mongolia region in the north.Chinese officials and state media have stressed that the government is fine-tuning but not abandoning what it calls a “dynamic"" zero-COVID policy, after rumors of an easing sparked a stock market rally earlier this month.Peking University students and faculty were not allowed to leave the grounds unless necessary and classes on the main campus — where the case was found — were moved online through Friday, a university notice said.DOHA, Qatar (AP) Amid skepticism after days of fan parades in Doha and throngs of people greeting team buses arriving at hotels, World Cup organizers insisted Wednesday the atmosphere is authentic.

4229,seeks games longterm,"Keep playing, keep paying: Ubisoft seeks games with “longterm engagement”","For a long time, Ubisoft was known for cranking out annual or near-annual releases in popular franchises like Assassin's Creed, Just Dance, Far Cry, the Tom Clancy games, and more. Now, though, the company is signaling it is in the middle of a major change in direction, focusing on fewer big-game releases that draw long-term support from both developers and players.""New releases now only represent a part of our business, which is now focused on longterm engagement with our player communities,"" Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot writes in a sprawling 256-page annual report released this week. ""Our players not only play for more hours at a time, but do so over a period of months or even years. We are thus able to offer them new experiences and content, thereby extending the lifetime of our games.""Guillemot points to Rainbow Six: Siege as the primary example of this new focus; the game saw its player base double between February 2016 and February 2017. But continued developer refinement and player engagement with online-focused titles like The Division, For Honor, and Steep also reflect the company's focus on ""live"" games, Guillemot says.Ubisoft's new focus doesn't come entirely out of left field. For years now, the industry as a whole has been gravitating toward a ""games as a service"" model that prizes continuing support for existing games. Now, though, Ubisoft is being quite explicit in moving to ""a model which is less dependent on releasing new games"" and more focused on ""developing numerous multiplayer games... which have dramatically increased player engagement.""An accompanying quarterly report Powerpoint presentation helps explain just why these long-lasting ""live"" games have become the company's primary concern. While ""traditional"" games tend to maintain only 13 percent of their revenue into their second year, ""live"" games bring in 52 percent of that first-year level into year two, according to Ubisoft's data.AdvertisementIn another slide, Ubisoft cites advantages like ""recurring revenue business,"" ""high user engagement,"" and a focus on ""lifetime value"" as benefits of these continuing games. The ""digital-first"" focus generates a ""more predictable & cash-generative business model and market"" than the former annual release cycle, Ubisoft says.With the new model also comes a new focus on the ""players' recurring investment"" as a major metric for the health of Ubisoft's business. Things like in-game items, DLC, season passes, subscription, and advertising revenue now make up 18 percent of Ubisoft's revenue, the company says, compared to 38 or 39 percent for the likes of EA and Activision. Raising this ratio ""has the potential to deliver prodigious value for our shareholders,"" Guillemot writes in the annual report.With these kinds of numbers, it's not hard to see why Ubisoft would shift its focus almost entirely away from annual single-player adventures and toward online-focused platforms that can be extended with new content indefinitely. Don't be surprised as you see that focus reflected more and more in the big-budget games released by Ubisoft and others going forward.Kyle Orland

3437,stores ransomware attack,Inside the turmoil at Sobeys-owned stores after ransomware attack,"Employees of Empire Co., the parent company of Sobeys, have begun to speak out about the turmoil unfolding inside the grocery chain since a ransomware attack began plaguing its computer systems earlier this month.Employees of Empire-owned stores say they've been unable to place orders and process inventory as usual in the wake of a ransomware attack. (Andrew Vaughan/The Canadian Press)Employees of Empire Co., the parent company of Sobeys, have begun to speak out about the turmoil unfolding inside the grocery chain since a ransomware attack began plaguing its computer systems earlier this month.Workers from across the country say some stores have run short of items because orders cannot be placed as usual, while at others, food that had gone bad initially either piled up or was frozen because it couldn't be removed from the inventory system.Pharmacies were unable to fill new prescriptions for a week, customers cannot redeem loyalty points or use gift cards, and staff were concerned last week they wouldn't get paid because the payroll system is down.""It's basically been a mess.… The word that can best describe it — just a mess,"" said one employee who works in the front end at a Safeway in western Canada.The CBC has agreed to protect the identities of employees it has spoken to, as they are worried they'll be fired if the company knows they shared internal information.Empire announced in a news release Nov. 7 that an ""information technology systems issue"" was disrupting some services, including filling prescriptions at pharmacies. The company did not respond to questions from the CBC last week, but said in a statement Nov. 11 its pharmacies were once again fully operational, though stores were still experiencing challenges.The company owns 1,500 stores across Canada, including Sobeys, Lawtons, IGA, Safeway, Foodland, Needs and other grocery outlets.Several cybersecurity experts have said they suspect the company's systems were hacked, and a ransomware attack — when hackers lock computer systems until money is paid — could be to blame.The employees who spoke with the CBC said ransomware was indeed the cause of the problem.""Somebody higher up got an email and basically clicked a link they weren't supposed to,"" said the front-end Safeway employee. ""I don't know the exact dollar figure, but I know it was like millions, like several millions.""The troubles began overnight Thursday, Nov. 3 into Friday, Nov. 4.When employees arrived for work on Friday, their computers took longer than usual to boot up, and when they finally did, ""nothing came up other than this big white block in the middle of the screen that said ransomware, please comply before proceeding, or something like that,"" said a worker in a meat and seafood department at a Safeway store.Employees were told not to log in, to unplug certain digital scales, and not to use the scanning equipment that allows them to track inventory.Without the computer systems and handheld scanners, called Telxon guns, stores have not been able to place orders, so in some cases, they have run out of certain items.After the first day or so of the outage, warehouses began to send products to stores based on what they had available and estimates of what they may need.A display case at Sobeys sits empty on Nov. 14, more than a week after a ransomware attack affected computer systems at the chain. Employees say the IT issue has affected their ability to bring in some items. (CBC)""It's hit and miss what the warehouse is going to send us,"" said one employee. ""So we're getting all kinds of weird stuff that we haven't seen in decades.""Some stores have not received any orders of a certain product, while others have, so employees from one store have driven over to pick up the needed items from another.At some stores, staff have been writing out price signs by hand because the system they usually use is not available.""When we finally get our system back, everything's going to be so out of whack because nothing is being scanned,"" said an employee.The computer issues have also disrupted Empire's ability to maintain its usual scheduling and payroll systems.""I literally went into work and there was like a schedule written down on a piece of paper and I'm like, what is this?"" said a worker.Some employees are being asked to write down their hours in a logbook.Employees in the chain are paid every other week, and some were told last week they would not get paid last Thursday, their scheduled payday.However, workers later told the CBC the company found a workaround: since the first week of the two-week pay period occurred before the ransomware attack, employees would receive the same amount of pay for the second week, even if they did not work the same number of hours. Each employee also received an extra $100 on Thursday to compensate for any extra hours they may have worked the second week.Once the payroll system is functioning again, any worker who was overpaid will be expected to return overpayments.Many customers are likely unaware of the difficulties employees are dealing with. But some impacts have been clear.On the first day of the outage, some self-checkout machines weren't working.""The lineups at the tills, because people aren't used to that and we pump a lot of people through these self checkouts — so, a lot of pissed-off customers over that,"" said a Safeway worker.Employees say some signs at Empire-owned stores are handwritten because they are unable to use some computer systems due to a ransomware attack. (CBC)Customers have been unable to use gift cards or redeem Scene loyalty points, and stores have been unable to process Western Union transfers — causing frustration for some, one employee said.The company has not officially told employees the cause of the outage. They have been instructed to simply tell customers it's an IT issue.""You kind of feel bad having to like just you know, water it down, what's really going on, to customers,"" said an employee. ""You feel like you're deceiving everybody because there's more going on behind the doors than what they're trying to make it out to be.""Sylvain Charlebois, the director of Dalhousie University's Agri-Food Analytics Lab, said he has noticed a lot of empty shelves at Sobeys-owned stores since the computer issue began.But so far, Canadians do not seem to be particularly concerned about the issue, he said.""If it gets worse, maybe at some point people will realize how significant a ransomware hitting the food industry can be,"" he said. ""This is the No. 2 grocer in the country dealing with cyber terrorism. That's a big deal.""Sylvain Charlebois is the director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University in Halifax. (Submitted by Sylvain Charlebois)He said the hack is worrisome from a privacy perspective, because the company holds personal data through credit and debit cards, loyalty programs and pharmacy prescriptions.But the disruption is also significant from a food-security perspective. The food retail industry is a high-volume, low-margin sector, so a significant hit from a ransomware attack could bring an entire company down, Charlebois said.That would mean part of the food distribution system could be disabled, and food prices would likely increase, at least temporarily.""I have faith in the food industry. They would recalibrate and restart and things like that. But it would take a while,"" Charlebois said.""Cybersecurity is a huge vulnerability for our supply chains for sure, especially when it comes to food. You're always a ransomware away from seeing food access becoming an issue in Canada.""To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

1858,oscars silent stars,"After the Oscars, what's next for silent stars of The Artist?","The IndependentIf they are anything like most Oscar winners, the team behind The Artist will have spent the first day of the rest of their lives conforming to the grandest, and most lucrative, of Hollywood traditions.Having woken up, pinched themselves, and made sure that -oui! - it really was a gold statuette on their bedside table, France's newly minted movie stars are likely to have devoted their waking hours to pondering two pressing questions: how to shift that throbbing hangover, and which of the myriad career choices suddenly on their horizon should they pursue next?Breaking the silenceThe first will not have been easily answered. Having sought refreshment at the Governor's Ball, the team who won five of Sunday's Academy Awards - including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor - adjourned to a packed party hosted by their film's distributor, Harvey Weinstein, at the Mondrian Hotel in Hollywood.Then they swept through Vanity Fair's bash, before continuing to the Chateau Marmont hotel, where at around four in the morning, several boisterous members of their entourage leapt into the swimming pool, fully clothed.The second post-Oscar question requires even more careful consideration. Like any winners of the biggest accolade in show business, The Artist's leading man Jean Dujardin, director Michel Hazanavicius, and producer Thomas Langmann will, for the time being, be inundated with potential job offers. But, as any Hollywood agent will tell you, an overabundance of choice doesn't always make for easy decisions.Leverage the successOn a purely pragmatic level, history suggests that all three can, if they so desire, leverage The Artist's success into financial security. The film has already made $76 million worldwide and is now being widened into more than 2,000 cinemas in the US, with a view to further capitalise on its Best Picture status.As well as ""back end"" earnings from that pot - which must also be dipped into by the voracious Weinstein - they are entitled to use their modish status to secure significant paydays."

Once again, they are the favorites to win the Grey Cup again towards the end of the year.For the first time this season, multiple Ontario online sportsbooks will feature futures for the East and West Divisions. BetRivers and FanDuel features some of the best odds available. Before kickoff in the regular season, Hamilton (East) and Winnipeg (West) are expected to win their respective divisions.Winnipeg is going to be the overwhelming favorite to win the 109th Grey Cup entering the new season. They had a dominant run through the prior regular season, only tallying up more losses later in the year after they locked up home field in the West Final. The playoffs were much more competitive, but they still took home the trophy.After the Blue Bombers, it’s quite a tossup among sportsbooks with multiple contenders. Saskatchewan notably had a strong defense last year, and Hamilton pushed Winnipeg to the limits in the Grey Cup.The three teams that didn’t make the postseason last year have the largest odds to win it all this season. Ottawa had a brutal campaign they’ll look to improve upon. Perhaps the biggest surprise is to see the BC Lions, normally a contender, holding the same odds as the Redblacks.Some sportsbooks will have regular-season win totals for CFL teams, like DraftKings Sportsbook. Odds for the over tend to have a little more juice than the under, with the lone exception being the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Here’s where the season win totals are currently set for all teams on DraftKings before we head into the new season. Note that these will expire by kickoff at 9:00 PM ET on Thursday (odds may vary).This year’s schedule more aligns with the traditional format we’ve seen in the past. Games are mostly played on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Some games will be played over the holidays on Mondays, and only two regular-season games are scheduled on Sunday. All five playoff games are played on the first three Sundays in November.In the opening week, the season kicks off with Montreal at Calgary on Thursday night. Winnipeg begins their title defense by hosting Ottawa on Friday night. The best matchup of the weekend is likely Hamilton taking on Saskatchewan on Saturday night.As usual, TSN will be the home for all CFL games in Canada this year. For the United States, all games will be broadcast on ESPN2, ESPNEWS, or ESPN+. Most of the action will be broadcast on the streaming service, especially when things roll into the college football season in the US.Brian Spaen is the Content Manager for Toronto Sports Media.

4921,tech downturn affected,How has the tech downturn affected founder mental health?,"Douglas is out this week so it’s just me, speaking again with Dr. Michael Freeman, founder of Econa, a global center of excellence for entrepreneur mental wellness based out of San Francisco.“There’s a direct relationship between the mental health of the entrepreneur and the performance of the company.”We first had Michael on the podcast in February of 2021, right at the heart of the endless pandemic. What I love about talking to him is that he’s both a psychiatrist and someone who understands the needs of the entrepreneur, which is a rarity.On this episode we focus on, well, the opposite of February 2021. Bearish economy, war, mass layoffs in tech for the first time in decades, and a waning pandemic. Let’s talk, again, about mental health.The BetaKit Podcast is sponsored by GSoft.

There's also the Chloë Grace Moretz-led action flick Shadow in the Cloud (2020), psychological horror film The Lodge (2019) and romance-gone-wrong Fresh (2022).

All scored higher than 70 on Metacritic.UniversalSimon Pegg plays a 29-year-old man named Shaun who is in a rut when the movie starts -- working a dead-end job and getting dumped by his girlfriend. But that all takes a backseat when he and his friend Ed (Nick Frost) discover the zombie apocalypse is at their doorstep. This hilarious (and at times thoroughly unsettling) flick is one you can devour again and again.IFC FilmsThis Finnish creature movie is plucked straight from your feathery nightmares. The flick introduces Tinja, a 12-year-old girl who discovers a strange egg that hatches into a monstrous bird. The horrendous creature contrasts greatly with her family's expectations of perfection.

This stunning, haunting Norwegian coming-of-age movie is a must-watch.HuluIf you count incredibly capable, invisible killing machines as scary, you may be watching some of the scenes in Prey through your fingers. This addition to the Predator franchise takes place in the Comanche Nation 300 years ago and centers on a young warrior named Naru. Watch this one for a compelling underdog story about a human determinedly fighting against a powerful alien."
